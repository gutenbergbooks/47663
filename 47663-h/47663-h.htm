<h2>A NOTE.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Many</span> regard the usual &ldquo;preface&rdquo; to a book as of
questionable value, but custom may justify the continuance
of its use.</p>

<p>I had long been a student of Anglo-Saxon history,
but until I went to Australia in 1893, I had seen little
hope for a realisation of the higher aspirations of the race.</p>

<p>Being an individualist, a democrat of democrats, I
hold that the unit of society is its basic factor, and, while
in those far-off lands, I saw a vague recognition of this
truth, I also saw a mergence of democracy into socialism,
that failed to satisfy my definitions.</p>

<p>I came to New Zealand in early 1903, on a lecture
tour. I was well received; and, as I could never remain
in a place over night without inquiring &ldquo;who started the
town,&rdquo; and for what purpose, I began an inquiry into the
situation.</p>

<p>I had heard and read that this colony was &ldquo;submerged
with socialism,&rdquo; and &ldquo;given over to the falsehood of
extremes,&rdquo; so I studied the literature, I mingled with the
people, I attended the parliamentary sittings, and&mdash;took
notes.</p>

<p>I found in the Press, a broad independence; in the
people, a sturdy self-reliance; and in the statesmen, a
feeling that they were the chosen servants of the public,
by whom a ripened sentiment was to be clothed in the
forms, and vitalised with the force, of law.</p>

<p>I found that what the uninformed derisively-called
&ldquo;Socialism&rdquo; consisted chiefly in a series of co-operative
measures, that seemed to promise, not &ldquo;nerveless socialism,&rdquo;
but the most sturdy democracy civilization had ever produced.</p>

<p>In my reveries, I reviewed the old books; I re-trod the
path of human progress; I re-measured the struggles
and the achievements of the Anglo-Saxon race, and,
comparing the environing conditions with the social
forces now at work, I wrote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Being a &ldquo;stranger,&rdquo; I had no interest, save in seeing
my long-cherished theories on the way to realisation;
having no acquaintances, I had no friends to flatter or
enemies to criticise; and, having no favors to ask, I found
it easy, in a free off-hand way, to note my impressions
with impartiality.</p>

<p>I clothed my subject in a garb of fiction, that I might
wrest from the reader the memories of the daily struggle
with stubborn facts; I adopted a style, that I believed
would be appreciated for its audacious novelty, and, though
the eloquent flights of my chief character may seem picturesque,
he but expresses the impressions, the feelings,
and, further, the opinions of&mdash;</p>

<h3>INCONCLUSIVE ALLUSIONS.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span>, being a true story, with the slight
deviations necessary to the preservation of
a due sense of proportion, it is deemed
proper to casually introduce the characters on
whom we must chiefly rely for the truthfulness
or otherwise, of a most romantic adventure.</p>

<p>In such an introduction, the Editor, or compiler&mdash;the
&ldquo;I&rdquo; in these pages&mdash;necessarily appears,
but to the Chronicler himself, who has
no &ldquo;poetic license,&rdquo; we must rely for the correctness
of the recital.</p>

<p>Though without my aid this strange story
might possibly have reached the world, the
manner of its coming into my hands has made
me a &ldquo;curtain-shifter,&rdquo; as it were, in the scenes,
and in this pleasing task, fidelity shall be my
only guide.</p>

<p>I was not &ldquo;journeying towards Damascus,&rdquo;
but being weary from many wanderings, and
desirous of returning to dear old London as
soon as possible, at Marseilles, I booked for
Amsterdam on the fine passenger steamer <i>Irene</i>&mdash;the
voyage, however, to be broken for a brief
stay over at Lisbon.</p>

<p>It was midnight when we swung from our
moorings and steamed out of the harbor, and,
the sea being rough and I a bad sailor, I did not
venture on the upper deck until nearly lunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
time the following day. I was not too well.
The sea was not placid, the air was damp and
chill, and&mdash;well&mdash;I was not happy.</p>

<p>The decks were &ldquo;sparsely populated,&rdquo; and as
I was slowly zigzagging my way along, in a sense
of utter loneliness, raising my eyes, my attention
was aroused by the presence of what seemed a
familiar figure. It was the graceful form of a
tall, well-proportioned young man. His face
was pale, his head was bent forward, he
leaned heavily over the starboard railing of
the vessel, and I imagined that he, too, was
not well. I did not recognise him, but sympathy
and curiosity, and, perhaps, custom, lead
me half unconsciously to his side. I said to
him soothingly, &ldquo;It is rather rough to-day.&rdquo;
He raised himself a little, leaned a little further
over the ship&rsquo;s railing, and made a convulsive
movement. He was &ldquo;not well,&rdquo; but raising
himself more erectly, he turned towards me
slightly, and ironically said, &ldquo;Thanks, so I
have been informed.&rdquo; The &ldquo;tone&rdquo; of the expression
was unkind, for my motives were good
and my conduct was as wise as the occasion
would suggest.</p>

<p>His voice limped piteously, but it had something
in it of old familiarity. &ldquo;You?&rdquo; said I.
My voice also had in it to him something of old
familiarity. I looked in his face. He returned
my gaze. The recognition was mutual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leo Bergin!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Marmaduke!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come to bring unholy memories,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have come to reproach me,&rdquo; said
he, in tones of agony I shall never forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Leo Bergin, I give my hand.
&lsquo;Let the dead past bury its dead.&rsquo; Look not
sorrowfully over the past&mdash;it comes not again&mdash;but
with resolute heart and strong hand brave
the future, and thou shall find a crown or a
grave. List&mdash;not another word of the past;
but, Leo Bergin, what of the future?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art kind,&rdquo; said he, with bowed head,
and in good Bible phrase, &ldquo;but I ill deserve
your generosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;List,&rdquo; said I again, &ldquo;Leo, what of the future?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The future?&rdquo; said he, with bowed head,
downcast eye, and awfully solemn voice, &ldquo;the
future? Because I know the past I feign would
die; because I know not the future, I am cowardly
enough to live. You know, my friend, my
benefactor, that I have talent, good looks, and
industry, but the world,&rdquo; said he more sadly,
&ldquo;is against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I had heard before that Leo Bergin had
&ldquo;talent, good looks, and industry.&rdquo; In fact,
Leo Bergin, on a memorable occasion, had
himself confessed to me as much. Ah! my
brothers, what good opinions we have of ourselves.
All of us, men and women, think ourselves
possessed of talent, good looks and social
merits; but here our self-satisfaction ends, for
the dull world, whom we could so well serve,
failing to appreciate us, we are left a prey to
neglect, and often to despair.</p>

<p>Ah! my brothers, we forget that we are not
impartial judges; that the world is impartial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and may be just in its conclusions. How
kindly we think of ourselves! In the person
who readily agrees with us, what noble qualities
of soul and mind we discover. But &rsquo;tis well, for
conceit, foolish as it may seem, often saves us
from despair.</p>

<p>Yes, Leo Bergin had talent, education,
good looks, and industry; but Leo Bergin, I
had concluded from the occasion referred to,
was erratic, &ldquo;a shingle short&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, not
&ldquo;all there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Leo,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;where are you bound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To h&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said he, in phrase quite
jocular, in tones almost bitterly sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;pack your kit then and step
off at old Cadiz, for that is on the border.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the bugle blew for lunch, and the association
of ideas drove Leo Bergin to his
cabin, and, with a sickly promise to &ldquo;come
later,&rdquo; I was left to ponder over the strange
events of life&mdash;events that often lead to
such meetings; the meetings, in turn, to lead
to other events, even more strange and interesting.</p>


<h3>A FRIEND IN NEED.</h3>

<p>Well, my reader, while Leo Bergin is below,
striving to compromise with his digestion, I will
relate to you some of his peculiarities, that you
may be prepared for his wonderful recital.</p>

<p>It was January 10th, 1898, as he entered my
room on Great Russell Street, just opposite the
British Museum, London, that I first saw him.
He knocked at my door, gently; he entered my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
room, quietly; he sat down familiarly, and he
opened the interview, promptly. I will not say
Leo Bergin, on this occasion, was not modest;
I will say he did not hesitate.</p>

<p>Had Leo Bergin remained silent I would
have known that he was out of money, out of
luck, out of friends, and almost out at the
knees and elbows. But he evidently doubted
my powers of perception, for, with superfluous
frankness and eloquent volubility, he informed
me that he only wanted a &ldquo;loan&rdquo;
for a short time until he could &ldquo;get on his
feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These stories were very common. They had
been very &ldquo;taking&rdquo; with me, but desiring to
avoid occupying a like position I had grown
impatient and crusty, possibly a little hard-hearted,
so I looked squarely into his fine
eyes, and asked him &ldquo;to get on his feet&rdquo; at
once.</p>

<p>He arose, looked me in the face, not with
defiance or humiliation, not with shame or
impudence, but like a man. He said, &ldquo;I am
down.&rdquo; That was evident, but the soft saying of
this had always cost me heavily, and, softening
again, I asked who he was and what he could
do.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;I am an American; I was born
in Virginia, lived in California, have done newspaper
work in New Zealand, and as a journalist
I am in London&mdash;and down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I weakened. The man who had been born
in Virginia, lived in California, and done newspaper
work in New Zealand, could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
wholly depraved, for the very air of these
three favored spots would preserve some semblance
of virtue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I surrender,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;express your most
fervent wish and it shall be granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He betrayed little emotion. His countenance
remained placid, but he said, &ldquo;I have talent,
good looks, and industry, and I want employment,&mdash;I
desire to earn my living. I asked
for a loan, but it was in despair, and I
desired to replace my lost revolver that I
might &lsquo;quit this ghastly dream called life&rsquo;
before another week&rsquo;s board was due. But
under the spell of your words, &lsquo;a change
came o&rsquo;er the spirit of my dream,&rsquo; and now I
must live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you assert this &lsquo;must&rsquo;
with such emphasis, perhaps you would tell
me why you <i>must</i> live? For my part I see no
actual necessity for it&mdash;not the least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cloud was on his brow. He remained
silent and immovable as a statue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for if you
desire to earn your living, I will secure a
position for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew who wanted a man, &ldquo;talented,
good-looking and industrious.&rdquo; I gave Leo
Bergin a suit of my clothes&mdash;just a little
soiled, I confess, for, as a fact, I never could
obey that divine injunction regarding the
giving my brother a coat, until it was a little
soiled. I gave him a strong letter to a friend
on Trafalgar Square, and Leo Bergin stepped
into a good position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>I was called to the Continent for a few
months on important duty. Time went on
and within a few weeks I received a brief note.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">&ldquo;Trafalgar Square,</span><br />
&ldquo;London.</p>

<p class="salutation">&ldquo;To my Benefactor,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours of &mdash;&mdash; received. Glad,&mdash;you deserve it. I
am well. I think my employer is satisfied, but I am a
little restless.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Leo.</span>&ldquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Talent, good looks, and ambition, but a
fool,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and he will never get on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few more weeks passed, and another note
came from &ldquo;Trafalgar Square, London.&rdquo; This
was less brief than the other. It read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">&ldquo;Trafalgar Square,</span><br />
&ldquo;London.</p>

<p class="salutation">&ldquo;Dear Sir,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leo Bergin is not at his desk. He has appropriated
enough of my money to enable him to take a vacation,
and&mdash;he left no address. Talent, good looks, and ambition
Leo Bergin has, to some degree, but he is evidently a
d&mdash;&mdash; villain. What did you know about this fellow,
anyway?</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">D. J. Folder.</span>&ldquo;</p></div>

<p>There seemed no vagueness in this note, but
I pondered. What did I know about him?
Only that he was once born in Virginia, had
lived in California, and had done newspaper
work in New Zealand. Musingly, I said, &ldquo;Perchance
the villain lied.&rdquo; This solved the problem
for the time, for it seemed more likely that
a man should even lie, than go wrong with such
a record.</p>

<p>For the time I lost all respect for Leo
Bergin. To deliberately rob a confiding employer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
is reprehensible, and if Leo Bergin in
this had not shown himself a thief, he had betrayed
an entire lack of a sense of proportion.
This was one side of Leo Bergin&rsquo;s character.</p>

<p>But lapses, my brothers, do not establish
total depravity, for it is reported &ldquo;of old&rdquo; that
a gentleman, on a very serious occasion, prevaricated
on a very potent fact, and when confronted,
&ldquo;he denied.&rdquo; When pressed, &ldquo;he
denied with an oath,&rdquo; and yet this gentleman
has been kindly remembered and well spoken
of.</p>


<h3>TEMPESTUOUS.</h3>

<p>The wind increased in violence. It was a
wild night. The blue Mediterranean was angry,
but the good ship plunged ahead like a defiant
monster. For two days more, the decks were
unoccupied save by the careless sailors. The
tables looked &ldquo;lonesome,&rdquo; for the storm still
raged in fury.</p>

<p>The hours and the days, that seemed like
weeks and months, wore away. We rounded
Cape Vincent, when immediately the wind
ceased, the sea was calm, the ship rode
smoothly, the air was balmy, and the passengers,
like a section of the morning of resurrection,
appeared plentifully upon the broad
clean decks, and were happy.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Leo Bergin also appeared on deck. His
smile was feeble, his grasp was languid, but
he spoke earnestly of beef-steak and coffee, and
I felt that he was&mdash;&ldquo;better.&rdquo; Old Cadiz had
been passed, and he had evidently concluded
to try some climate other than the one previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>suggested. We sat&mdash;we chatted. I was
to leave the ship at Lisbon, finishing my
journey by the next steamer. He?&mdash;I did not
know. Strange, when we do people a favour
we at once feel an interest in them. Possibly
we feel somewhat responsible for such an one&rsquo;s
conduct. Possibly, too, and more likely, we
desire their success, that we may take to ourselves
a little credit for a &ldquo;happy career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had done Leo Bergin a favor, was interested
in him, and asked as to his &ldquo;future.&rdquo;
His glance was friendly, his smile doubtful;
he drew his chin lower on his bosom, drummed
on a book with his gloved fingers, and said,
&ldquo;Well, I have made an acquaintance with a
mysterious personage. I have talent, good
looks, and ambition, but I am an outcast, and
I am going on a new venture. You know the
Folder episode, and, to be frank, after a serious
review of the case, I question the propriety of
my action, and now that the money is gone, I
have many qualms of conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not a little surprised, but I was glad
to discover that he believed himself to have a
little conscience, for as &ldquo;conscience does make
cowards of us all,&rdquo; I hoped for his reform.</p>

<p>We sat side by side, and planting his closed
hand firmly on my knee by way of emphasis,
he said, &ldquo;Yes, I have made a new acquaintance,
that of a mysterious personage, and I
am now starting on the most reckless, the
most risky, the most irrational, and the most
romantic venture ever undertaken by mortal
man, and if I succeed you shall hear from me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
but if I fail, oblivion will claim Leo Bergin, and
the claim will be promptly allowed. I made my
new acquaintance and formed my new plans but
yesterday, and I stand at the dawn of the most
enchanting dream that ever lured a sensible
man to ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I begged him to unfold his tale, but he
answered, &ldquo;You are a practical man, and you
would regard my undertaking as so wild and
visionary as to indicate insanity, for you do
not regard me as an imbecile. If I fail, only
another leaf, its stem nipped by the frost, flutters
to the ground to fertilise the soil. If I fail,
the world, save you, knows not of my folly. If
I succeed, the facts that I shall reveal will be more
strange than fiction, and the results of my adventure
will redound to the glory of the land I love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ill as I was,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I began my
notes yesterday, October 5th, 1898, off the coast
of Spain, and I shall keep a true record of
my doings and my observations. If I survive,
which is hardly likely, I shall find you and
place my notes at your disposal. If I perish&mdash;if
possible you shall have them brought down
to the last breath, and in every page you shall
have evidence of my gratitude and my integrity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; said I, with impatience.
Here the whistle blew, we saw all confusion,
and we were entering the port of Lisbon. Time
for further explanation, there was none. We
separated, I to follow out well-laid plans for
business and pleasure, he&mdash;well, to me it was
an unsolvable riddle; but I never lost faith that,
some time and in some place, Leo Bergin would
again turn up.</p>

<h2><a name="SCENE_II" id="SCENE_II"></a><i>SCENE II.</i></h2>

<h3>LEO BERGIN &ldquo;TURNS UP.&rdquo;</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Two</span> years had passed, and with all my professions
of interest and regard, for a full
year of that time Leo Bergin had not
entered my mind, and for the whole two years,
he had occupied very little of my thoughts. As
a fact, save on one occasion when D. J. Folder,
in forgiving jest told me that he needed a man,
and asked if I could recommend a young man
with &ldquo;talent, good looks and ambition,&rdquo; for the
position, I do not remember having thought of
Leo Bergin.</p>

<p>Absence defaces memory. Ah! how quickly
we are forgotten. We spend our brief time
upon this showy stage, assuming that we are
necessary to the world&rsquo;s success or pleasure,
but when we drop to senseless dust, all save
a few, go merrily on, and even they, in a day
or a few days, dry their tears and join the
happy throng again.</p>

<p>Later, in the autumn of 1900, I was called
to Copenhagen on business, and having made
the acquaintance of a prominent physician
there, I was invited to visit one of the leading
hospitals.</p>

<p>In going the rounds of the various wards,
we were informed that several new patients
had just entered, brought from a ship which
had returned from a North Polar voyage.
This would satisfy some curiosity, and soon we
were among the new patients. There were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
dozen in all, mostly Russians, Finns, and
Danes, but at one side of the ward we
noticed there were two pale-looking fellows,
conversing in English.</p>

<p>Instinctively I walked across to their presence,
when to my astonishment, gazing earnestly
at me, I recognised the sad, pitiful face, of
emaciated, health-broken Leo Bergin.</p>

<p>His eyes brightened slightly, he smiled
faintly, and reached a feeble faltering hand to
meet mine, in friendly greeting. There was
time for smiles of waning joy, time for sighs and
tears of pity, but for words, the time had well nigh
sped, for Leo Bergin was close to the pearly gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit close,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sit close, for I am
sailing for another port, and while I don&rsquo;t know
the nature of the climate, there can be nothing
better, and nothing worse than I have had in
this world, so let the storm howl, and the ship
plunge, I am not whining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he slightly turned on his bed, and
reaching a thin hand under his pillow, he drew
forth a package wrapped in some soft skin,
and tied about with twine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he faintly, &ldquo;this tells the
whole story. It is all good &lsquo;stuff,&rsquo; but I
place it at your disposal. If you think it
better, you may boil it down, and if you make
anything out of it, well, pay Folder, for I had
a good time with his money, and now I have
plenty to last me through. I don&rsquo;t know how,
but some way I knew I should find you, and
this,&mdash;it is all true, but the dreams of fiction
never unfolded anything half so strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>I longed for a few more minutes, but the
form of Leo Bergin lay limp on the bed. His
hands were lax, his brow wore a deathly pallor,
and his lips moved slowly in inaudible whispers.
I touched his hand, for I wanted one more
word, and as he seemed to slightly revive, I
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell my soul, with sorrow laden,&rsquo; where
have you been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He aroused a little, smiled, and pointing to
the package, gaspingly said, &ldquo;It is all there, all
there, and I&mdash;well, I have been to &lsquo;Symmes&rsquo;
Hole,&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and when I looked again upon that
placid face, the soul of Leo Bergin had sailed
for the other &ldquo;Port.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>ADJUSTING THE CURTAINS.</h3>

<p>Leo Bergin, with neatness and despatch,
was comfortably buried, myself being chief
mourner, and &ldquo;after life&rsquo;s fitful fever he sleeps
well.&rdquo; I was impatient to know the contents
of the package, but desiring to enjoy perfect
leisure, while unravelling the mystery so intensified
by Leo&rsquo;s earnestness, I reluctantly
laid it away, to wait my arrival in London.</p>

<p>Time passed.</p>

<p>I was back at my old quarters in Great
Russell Street, London. The weather was so
chill, dark, and foggy, that, at four, I had
lighted the gas. The fire burned lazily in the
small grate. The room was not uncomfortable,
but in harmony with the gloomy surroundings.
I was touched by a feeling of depressing loneliness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
I paced the not very expansive floor,
peered through the blackness into the dimly
lighted streets, paced again, lighted a cigar,
sat and pondered.</p>

<p>Thrown back in an easy chair, dreamingly
watching the graceful whirling wreaths of my
consoling Havana, my thoughts on random
wing soared aimlessly away, to gather up the
memories of vanished days. Then, like gladsome
youths on holiday, came trooping along
the casual incidents of an easy life, my last
visit to Venice, my run to Marseilles with
Monarco&rsquo;s party, the stormy voyage along the
coast of Spain. Ah! here, in flesh and blood
with spare but athletic form, pale scholarly
face, pleasing but rather melancholy smile,
gentle voice and cordial, arose Leo Bergin; a
thought! The form vanished, but the &ldquo;package&rdquo;
was more substantial, and I hurriedly unpacked
my trunk, and drew it forth, just as he
had given it me fully three months earlier.</p>

<p>With a thrill of mingled pain and pleasure,
I removed the rough twine, and unrolled the
leather wrapping. My heart throbbed with
emotion, my hand trembled, but my eager
eyes beheld a large roll of manuscript neatly
tied with familiar tape.</p>

<p>While I had not even a glimpse of the
nature of these notes, I did not even guess,
or attempt to guess, their character. I knew
that Leo Bergin, when quite alive, had talent
and ambition&mdash;the good looks for this occasion
I will omit&mdash;and I knew this was a most interesting,
if not an important &ldquo;find.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>In contemplating the situation, as I leisurely
removed all surplus or superfluous covering, a
small scrap of soiled and crumpled paper fell
to the floor, and on picking it up, I was not
a little surprised to see that it was an especial
note. It was written in a feeble, but legible
hand, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">&ldquo;Nowhere,</span><br />
&ldquo;November, 1900.</p>

<p class="salutation">&ldquo;To whoever may find the within,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I am breathing my last, and I am a little anxious
to be off, I pray you to forward at once to Sir Marmaduke,
Colonial Club, Whitehall, London.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Leo Bergin.</span></span><br />
&ldquo;Richmond Virginia, late of &lsquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This was another side of the character of
Leo Bergin. Mentally, I was in what may, I
think with some propriety, be termed a state of
deeply interested confusion. I unrolled and
exposed to view the whole package. It was
voluminous. It was composed of some twenty
writing tablets, each with a large number of
thin sheets, foolscap size. These tablets were
consecutively numbered, the pages were closely
written on one side, the first few being in a
round neat hand, the skill rather weakening as
the work proceeded.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 330px;">

abilities are as versatile as his duties are varied.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I was too eager for a general inspection to
deliberately peruse any particular portion or
feature of the whole, but there was a sufficient
mass of what seemed by the painstaking
methods to make a large volume.</p>

<p>But the mystery still deepened. Where, for
what purpose, and under what circumstances,
was the work done? There were here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
there strange names of places, strange personages
and strange events recorded. Was Leo
Bergin mad? or was there, in fact, somewhere
passing events that were indeed stranger to us
than fiction?</p>

<p>My cigar went out, the fire had &ldquo;followed
suit,&rdquo; I looked at my watch with some impatience,
and it showed the &ldquo;wee sma&rsquo; hours&rdquo;
had come. I was perplexed, paced the floor,
and looking out into the street, I saw how the
gusts of wind drove the snow and sleet along
with the fury of a demon. I shuddered as I
paced the floor, but how could I unravel the
mystery, the mystery that perplexed me?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back into my chamber turning, all my soul
within me burning,&rdquo; I said again, &ldquo;Where is
the key?&rdquo; for Leo Bergin had talent and
ambition, and while he seemed erratic, he
was no visionary dreamer. While Leo Bergin
lacked a sense of proportion, even in his foibles
he was practical, and had at least one eye on
the main chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Leo Bergin was no dreamer,&rdquo;
he had no fads, no superstitions, and little imagination,
and he was a true Bohemian. He
had a &ldquo;nose for news,&rdquo; a genius for work, and a
love for adventure that all the fiends in and
out of Hades could not thwart.</p>

<p>But how could I unravel the mystery?
Where the de&rsquo;il had he been for two long
years? Who was Symmes? And if Symmes
had a hole, where was it?</p>

<p>Here I paused&mdash;an idea struck me. &ldquo;I am
a fool,&rdquo; said I&mdash;but I would rave should any one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>less informed regarding my weakness say so.
Ah! I have it. Here it is, for he said, on our
parting, as he handed it to me, &ldquo;It is a record
of every day&rsquo;s doings and events.&rdquo; Yes, and he
said, on our parting at Lisbon, &ldquo;I made
my new acquaintance, and laid my plans for
future action yesterday. I have begun my
work, and I shall keep a truthful record of
every day&rsquo;s doings and events, and on my return
I will place it at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plain enough, it is all there, and to-morrow
I shall begin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to unravel this mysterious
story.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SCENE_III" id="SCENE_III"></a><i>SCENE III.</i></h2>

<h3>A STRANGE STORY.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;To-morrow&rdquo;</span> has come. The outside
world seems glad to be alive. I&mdash;the
Editor&mdash;accustomed to mental ease and
physical comfort, am confronted with perplexing
duties. My bills are paid, my health is
good, and my mind is clear, but, confound the
idea of work! I never liked work, and I fear
even custom will not reconcile me to drudgery.
But duty calls, and, so far, duty has
never called upon me in vain.</p>

<p>I&mdash;the Editor, remember&mdash;am ashamed
that I forgot Leo Bergin for two long years;
I am more ashamed that I so nearly forgot
the package, the contents of which may bring
pleasure to many a curious and careworn soul,
for, as a fact, I feel rebuked even by the
presence of this evidence of sturdy resolve,
so wanting in myself. As a fact, I know, when
I care to be serious, that Leo Bergin, with
his restless ambition, his tireless industry, his
dauntless courage, his reckless love of adventure,
and his almost insane determination to
turn on a little more light, with all his faults,
was worth to his kind, more than a legion of
happy idlers, who, like myself, were born in
wealth, and indolently dallied in the soft lap of
luxury, careless alike to the sorrows and the
joys of common humanity.</p>

<p>Well, as a compromise with my conscience&mdash;I
think it must be conscience, for the sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
is new to me&mdash;I am determined to unravel
the mystery of Leo Bergin&rsquo;s absence,
and, if in the mass of labored matter, there is
one thought or fact or idea worthy of his fine
attainments and insane strife, the world shall
find some compensation for his many errors.</p>

<p>With comfortable surroundings, cheerful fire,
easy chair, convenient desk and table, fine
cigars, ample library, a new found sense of
duty, an industry aroused by remorse, and with
a sense of deep responsibility I begin my
work, feeling that the suggestion from the
dying author to &ldquo;boil it down&rdquo; has vastly
augmented the difficulties that confront me.</p>

<p>I am abundantly aware that the age is
athirst for fiction, whereas I have for its
patience but a plain unvarnished tale. I know
the taste for graceful periods, while I can give
but labored phrase, and I know the critics want
only the &ldquo;meat,&rdquo; while I must crave the indulgence
of an occasional flourish.</p>

<p>For the present, at least, I shall &ldquo;boil down&rdquo;
the matter contained in Leo Bergin&rsquo;s copious
notes. In this I may do him an injustice, but
I shall save myself much toil and mental worry.</p>

<p>Of Leo Bergin I shall speak well. He is
dead&mdash;and by the world&rsquo;s philosophy, we should
speak kindly of the dead. What a vile philosophy!
Why not speak kindly of the living?
Why do we taunt, and harpoon, and revile the
erring soul, until it drops into senseless dust,
and then, when our poisoned shafts no longer
sting, feel constrained to &ldquo;speak kindly of the
dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh! my brothers, be good to me while I am
alive; you may encourage me, aid me, save me, and
when I am dead, you have a standing invitation
to my funeral, and your tongues will not grieve me.</p>

<p>But, goodbye, indolent reverie, goodbye
dreamy speculation, goodbye ease and careless
waste of precious hours, and welcome toil, for
I am going to do penance, so welcome wearisome
work, and welcome thou confused mass
of spoiled and rumpled paper, for I long to
release the winged words, held so sacredly in
your perishable grasp.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Tis a strange mystery, the power of
words. Life is in them, and death. A word
may send the crimson current hurrying to the
cheek, hurrying with many meanings, or may
turn it, cold and deadly, to the heart. And
yet, a word is but a breath of passing air.
This is pretty&mdash;I hope it is original, but I fear
it is not&mdash;but here begins the diary, a full record
of the doings and observations of Leo Bergin
for two eventful years. Where is number one?
Ah! here it is, a few little old crumpled sheets
I had not seen. No. 1 plain enough. He
began on these, and laid in his supply of paper
later. I will quote <i>verbatim</i> the first few pages,
as they may furnish the key to the whole.</p>

<p>Well, then, this is the starting of that career,
I hope an interesting one. It begins:&mdash;</p>

in &lsquo;imminent danger.&rsquo; Danger! how thrilling!&mdash;if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a fellow were not so sick. Terrible storm!
But, as compared with my tempestuous soul, the
angry Mediterranean is still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret having met Sir Marmaduke. He
did me a kindness; I served Folder well; Lucile,
and I&mdash;a poor adventurer&mdash;became friends. <i>The
Times</i> wanted me to go to Armenia; I borrowed
the money from young Folder in his father&rsquo;s
absence; young Folder, it seems, took the
money from the firm&rsquo;s safe; he fell into disgrace
with his father, accused me, and&mdash;well, Folder
and Sir Marmaduke and dear Lucile, all think
me a thief. Let the old Mediterranean howl,
let her mountainous waves plough the ground,
until all the bones of all she has slain are
washed up and cast on the shores of bloody
Spain, and until the Pillars of Hercules are
torn from their base, and I will laugh at
raving Nature&rsquo;s petulant moods, and go down
smiling with the wreckage to death and eternal
night. But confound young Folder! and, but
for Lucile, I would teach him a sense of proportion.
Sir Marmaduke shall sometime know
that he was not mistaken in me&mdash;and Lucile&mdash;well,
maybe she&rsquo;d rather think me a villain,
than to know her brother was one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, well! &ldquo;Oh, my prophetic soul!&rdquo;
Leo Bergin, forgive! Then, Leo was not a
thief, and I, like a common fool, now that the
truth is out should have known that Leo
Bergin, with his fine attainments, his superb
vanity, and his indifference to wealth, could
not stain his hands with dishonor. Surely it
was a foolish proceeding at such a juncture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for Leo Bergin to die. What fine material
for a romance! But we never romance. He
continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning I discovered that I had a
strange cabin mate. Physically, he is the finest
type of manly beauty I ever beheld; and, mentally,
he seems above our common human nature.
That he is no fool is certain, that he is not insane,
I am fairly well persuaded, and that he is mistaken
seems hardly credible, yet as measured by
all the supposed knowledge of our generation,
by the demonstrations of science and the
calculations of thinkers, he talks the most
arrant nonsense. His splendid personality, his
easy graceful manners, and his general intelligence
interests one; his &lsquo;sublime gift of
eloquent gab,&rsquo; his seeming logic, and his insinuating
ideas are charming, but the seeming
boldness, not to say audacity of his statements
astonishes one. But to me, he is resistless;
and for good or ill, success or failure, life or
death, I have cast my lot with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evening, later. Strange experience this&mdash;the
storms have no terror for me. Strange!
but this mysterious cabin mate has captivated
me. I was so bewildered with his impossible
statements and extravagant claims, and with all
his absolute indifference as to our incredulity,
that I sought refuge in the captain&rsquo;s room,
and here, listening to an interesting recital, I
spent four of the most thrilling hours of my
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain is certainly a gentleman of
superior parts. He has a fine knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
astronomy, he is a master of geography, and
is deeply read in the broader and more general
physical sciences, and yet, in the presence of
this stranger, as he seems not of our world
in any sense common to our understanding,
he is dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This strange being, surely a man, for he
eats and drinks and smokes, and worse, he
snores, says he is Amoora Oseba, that he lives
in a great city called Eurania, in a country
called Cavitorus, and that his people are called
Shadowas. Save that the mind wanders with
an unconscious effort to locate this country,
city, and people, this statement seems but commonplace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is Cavitorus? Where is the
City of Eurania? and who the de&rsquo;il are the
Shadowas? Save that he might be regarded
as a superior sample, this Amoora Oseba&mdash;which
sounds Arabian&mdash;might be taken easily
for a Russian, a Dane, a Scot, or a Yankee.
But whence came he? Let him tell us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the captain&rsquo;s suggestion, I invited him
to the fore-cabin, where, seated around a table,
our host, the chief engineer, a merchant from
Boston, a parson, my cabin mate and myself,
were met for interesting inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The instruments having been brought and
the glasses filled, the captain looked in the
face of Mr. Oseba, and said in manly business
tones, &lsquo;We have become interested in you, Mr.
Oseba, and while your statements seem most
astounding to us, we have invited you to my
cabin, that we might persuade you to give us
some explanation of your strange theories; and
as an introduction of the subject, I beg to inquire
from what country you hail, and what is
your destination?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question seemed rational, and to most
men, how easily answered! But here was a
new experience. All eyes were turned on the
handsome, intelligent, earnest face of my new-made
friend and fellow-passenger, and he said:
&lsquo;Mystery lies just beyond the visible horizon of
the knowable. Because I have explored the
realms of your mental and visible horizon,
either of you could easily answer me such a
question, and to the satisfaction of all; but as
my country lies beyond both your mental and
visible horizon, I can only answer by an explanation,
moving or advancing such lines.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here Amoora Oseba took a globe in his
hand, and remarked that as educated men they
regarded this as a &lsquo;counterfeit presentment&rsquo; or
model of the world they inhabited. He explained
that for millions of years, our ancestors
remained indifferent, and then disputed about
the shape or form of the world they inhabited;
that in comparatively recent times loving men
cooked one another for believing the world to
be round, and that in times really but yesterday,
the most advanced people had nothing
like a correct conception of the construction
of the Universe.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In old, old times,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;our ancestors
believed the world to be flat. That question
for thousands of years was considered settled.
For a comparatively brief time the world has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a><br /><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>been considered to be round, a solid sphere.
This, for this short period, has been the
&ldquo;settled&rdquo; notion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he assured us that the propositions
were equally fallacious. The whole
party was inclined to laugh, but he continued.
He reminded us that we all believed in the
nebular theory, that our earth, with the other
planets, had been thrown off by the sun&rsquo;s rapid
rotary motion; that in rapid revolution these
masses had assumed forms peculiar to their
revolutionary velocity, that planets had in turn
thrown off masses that had become satellites,
and that form was a result of motion, mass,
and volume. He reminded us of the natural
tendency of matter to fly from the surface of
a rapidly revolving wheel, cylinder, or globe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the case with our earth. While
yet a yielding or molten mass, it whirled very
rapidly on its axis, the surface cooled and
became rigid, and the molten matter contracted.
During this process, the plastic interior
moved towards the crust, the cooling
mass requiring less and less space. Thus
the centre parted, and our earth became, not
a solid globe, as you were taught to believe,
but an oval ring, a hollow ball, revolving
rapidly as do the rings of Saturn, formed
under the same law, but owing to the mass
in her case being greater, the gravitation of
the interior held the central mass together as
a planet. &lsquo;As a fact,&rsquo; he said, taking a large
apple in his hand, &lsquo;if the core of this apple
were removed with a care that would preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the proper curvature, I will venture to say
&ldquo;ovality,&rdquo; it would present an exact model of
our world. Then the world is hollow, not solid,
and it is habitable and inhabited over the oval.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The members of the party looked at each
other with amused curiosity. &lsquo;Symmes!&rsquo; said
the captain; &lsquo;Hurra for old Kentuck!&rsquo; said the
Yankee; &lsquo;Logic!&rsquo; said the engineer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You smile,&rsquo; said Oseba, &lsquo;but a man may smile
and smile, he may even sneer, and still be wrong.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked so undisturbed, so dignified and
earnest, that levity ceased, and he said &lsquo;As a
rule, men accept their opinions ready made, and
they only search for corroborating evidence.
When Galileo proclaimed a new truth, he was
silenced, by the frowns of authority. Who was
right? When Bruno proclaimed a great truth,
he was cooked, by authority. Who was right?
All your schoolboys of to-day know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But when Symmes advanced a new theory,
because the world had grown more tolerant or
less earnest, he was laughed out of court, while
those who imprisoned Galileo, and cooked
Bruno, and ridiculed Columbus and Magellan,
having grown careless, amused themselves
by writing of Symmes&rsquo; northern regions as
&ldquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mr. Oseba, &lsquo;I am
from over the Oval, from &ldquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole,&rdquo; and
after five years of constant travel and hard
study among the people of the outer world,
whom we call Outeroos, I am returning to
&ldquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole,&rdquo; and this young man,&rsquo; turning
to me, &lsquo;is going with me to report.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no mirth, the captain drumming
on the table said, &lsquo;Ahem!&rsquo; The Yankee
said, as he looked quizzically at me, &lsquo;Well, I
guess he&rsquo;ll have to muffle himself up pretty
good, and I think our house could give him a
proper outfit,&rsquo; and the engineer said to me,
&lsquo;raising the curtain is the most interesting part
of the performance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But this is so far outside of our experience
and our observations,&rsquo; said the good-natured
skipper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon,&rsquo; said the calm Oseba, &lsquo;the observations
of your men of experience have but
confirmed our contentions, though the evidence
so far, has not disturbed the hypotheses of your
theorists. But what are the observations of
your men of hard experience? This leads to
another line of inquiry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save by an occasional question, the silence
of the listeners had been unbroken from the
start. The subject had been profoundly discussed,
and as the hour was growing late, it
was agreed that the party meet at once after
dinner on the following evening. All faces
now looked serious. The captain thanked the
stranger, and said, &lsquo;We met to scoff, we remained
in rapt attention, we retire to meditate.
To-morrow evening,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we will question
you, our worthy guest, with a different feeling.
Good night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a unique experience! How I would
like to have had Sir Marmaduke with us. But
Sir Marmaduke thinks I am a thief and unworthy
of his presence.</p>

<p>By George! that is striking. The man
from &ldquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole.&rdquo; Ha! Ha! Well, I
wish I had been there. But Leo Bergin does
me an injustice, for I was too careless to think
about his crime, or alleged crime, for, as a fact,
I liked him when I met him, and in his absence,
I never thought either of him or his folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fools we mortals be!&rdquo; We are
eternally worrying about what others think of
us, when, in fact, each of all the &ldquo;others&rdquo; is
quite engaged with his or her own affairs. What

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis midnight&rsquo;s holy hour, and silence now

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What an eventful day! In old Lisbon a
few hours, made a few purchases&mdash;paper to
hold stuff enough to startle the world&mdash;saw
Sir Marmaduke on the steps of the Cathedral;
he did not answer my salute. If I live, he
shall know me better. If&mdash;oh, that terrible
&lsquo;if&rsquo;! that brief halt, that in all our hopes
arises to console us, that brief halt that excuses
impotency for failure, chills me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had a long chat with my chief, Oseba, <i>re</i>
our polar journey. Strange, I speak of this
with candour, and make my plans as if it were
actual, and yet my judgment scoffs at my
foolish dreams, for, as a fact, it must be the
delusion of a madman. So I thought at 4 p.m.&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promptly at eight, the party of last
evening re-assembled in the captain&rsquo;s cabin.
All seated at the table, Amoora Oseba handed
round some fine cigars, the glasses were filled,
and the skipper said, &lsquo;Now, Mr. Oseba, we
would like to hear further from you, for if you
are insane, there seems to be method in your
madness. If you are a joker, you are a most
charming entertainer, but if you are sane and
candid, for the world&rsquo;s good you should remain
quiet, only when necessary to refresh yourself
for further effort.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain had prepared a six-inch globe
by removing the axial core, and paring down
the outer openings so as to leave it oval with the
outer curves for Mr. Oseba&rsquo;s convenience in
making his illustrations&mdash;this was Oseba&rsquo;s
&lsquo;apple,&rsquo; the core removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On rising, Mr. Oseba thanked the captain
for his courtesy, and raising the globe, he reminded
the party that he was to review the
observations of experienced men in support
of what to him was more than a theory. He
asked his friends to fix in their minds the new
form of our globe, for that was important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He first called attention to the fact that all
the extreme North Polar regions were rich with
the waste or remains of animal and vegetable
life. This was &lsquo;settled.&rsquo; &lsquo;All navigators
agree,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that hibernating animals,
say above 80 or even 78°, go north to
winter; and that driftwood comes from the
north with flowers unknown to botanists. In
high latitudes birds and swarms of insects come
from the north in spring, and Tyson&rsquo;s men
killed many of these migrating birds for food
for his crew. In the craws of these birds there
were found undigested grains of wheat, some of
which were planted and grew in California.
The kernel of this wheat was three times the
common size, and California seasons were too
short for its ripening. Now, whence came the
birds, the wheat, and the insects? Plainly,
from &ldquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole.&rdquo; Greely found the ice
but four feet thick at 82°, and less than
two feet at 84°, so the ice would not bear the boats, and many navigators report an open
polar sea, and greatly agitated waters at high
latitudes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By the old theory, it must be known that,
at the poles, the North Star would be&mdash;must be&mdash;directly
overhead, or in the zenith. But, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
fact, all polar explorers know that the pole star
is in the zenith at about 80°, and that, at 83-4°,
it is seen far towards the stern of the ship. If
the old theory were true, this phenomenon seen
at 84° would only appear after a ship had sailed
past the Pole some ten or twelve degrees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;sailing north at
84°, the verge is past, the curvature is sharper,
and the ship is dipping into &ldquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole.&rdquo;
Further, at 82° north, the horizon very sensibly
contracts to the north and south, and
enormously lengthens east and west. This is
on the verge, at the point of sharpest curvature.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While these arguments were not entirely
new to the captain, they struck him with a new
force, and the party remained silent. Assuming
that he had made out his case, the Sage assured
us confidently that the earth was hollow, with
openings at the Poles; that the equatorial sides
are about 3000 miles thick; that the surface of
the interior world, like that of the outside, has
mountains and plains, rivers and lakes; that
it has proportionately less habitable lands, an
equatorial zone of some 2000 miles being quite
uninhabitable; that on either side of this there
is a habitable belt of variable width; that from
the sun and its reflections, and electrical phenomena,
there are ample light and heat; and
that about 3000 miles north of the equator, just
under and opposite the Greenwich meridian,
stands the City of Eurania&mdash;the most beautiful
and opulent on this planet&mdash;the capital of a
great and wealthy country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence reigned for a few moments, when
the deeply interested Boston man, in the most
inquisitive and earnest tones said, &lsquo;But, my
dear Sir, as we are evidently of about the same
class of goods, and were probably turned out
of the same mill, how the de&rsquo;il did you fellows
get down there? and how the de&rsquo;il did you get
out?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This discussion, so learned, so full, so
logical, so eloquent, and so earnest, should be
preserved, even to the tones and expression, but
I am weary, and it is late, and if&mdash;there is
that &lsquo;if&rsquo; again&mdash;if I live, nothing of that scene
shall perish; and if I don&rsquo;t&mdash;and, I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I
will have spent time enough on it, for all will
probably be lost, so I will &lsquo;boil it down.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in answer, Amoora Oseba said that
it was now a well-settled theory that, probably
owing to periodic oscillations of the earth,
the course and character of which were not yet
understood, there had been great changes in the
temperature of the polar regions. The moving
down and the receding of the polar ice limits,
in no distant geological times in the past are
abundantly evident. The temperature at the
so-called Poles had materially varied, the ice-belt
so oscillating that at times animal and
higher vegetable life flourished at high latitudes,
as is known by the abundant remains of
undecayed animals still found in the ice fields.</p>

<h3>A PRETTY TALE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Then he related a tradition among his
people, reciting that in the far distant past&mdash;at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a><br /><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>a time probably when the polar regions were
rather temperate, and most of the human race
were yet in barbarism&mdash;a small tribe of peacefully
disposed people inhabited a fertile region
in an open world, where the horizon stretched
away alike in all directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief of these amiable people was an
attractive and commanding personality named
Olif. This Olif had a most beautiful daughter,
whose mother, while gathering flowers for her
child, had been strangled by the orders of an
envious and childless queen. The name of the
daughter was Eurania, which means &ldquo;Sunbeam.&rdquo;
But as she grew to womanhood she so strongly
resembled her father, and was so constantly
at his side, that the two beings seemed a
double&mdash;but a single soul&mdash;and soon the people
idolised the damsel under the name of Oliffa.
Olif and Oliffa, the chief and his daughter, as
guardian spirits, held supreme authority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a great festival, in which many kindred
tribes and nations met to celebrate an historic
event, a grim chieftain of a warlike tribe
became enamoured of Oliffa. He demanded her
as one of his wives. Oliffa declined&mdash;there was a
rush to arms, and many of Olif&rsquo;s people were slain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great King Oonah took sides with his
warlike chief. Oliffa was taken by force, she
was led to an altar in sight of her people, her
ankles were loaded with fetters, her whole tribe
were condemned to extinction, and preparations
were being made for the general massacre.
When the King, beholding Oliffa that she was
stately, beautiful, and wise withal, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let not Olif and his tribe be slain, but
banished&mdash;banished; for &lsquo;tis not well that so
goodly a people should perish from the earth.
I have spoken.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Olif and his followers gathered themselves
together, and the warriors, joining in one
defiant voice, answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;While we may not hope to resist the force
of your savage chieftains who would expel us,
we will fight here until we all die, under the
gaze of Oliffa; and,&rsquo; said they in thunderous
tones, &lsquo;we have spoken.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oliffa, heroic in her despair, raised herself
to her full height, and, lifting her hands
imploringly to the National Gods, in a clear
and earnest voice that made the chieftain quail,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, my father and my people, die not, but
live for Oliffa&mdash;save a remnant of the tribe of
Olif. I am Oliffa&mdash;human virtue is greater
than kings or death. Go to the north, dwell in
the hollow of my hand, and, in the fulness of
time, thou shalt return to embrace me.&rsquo; She
had finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With bowed head and in sorrow, Olif and
his followers withdrew, and slowly wended their
way towards the unknown regions of the north.
But a party, with the angry chief Sawara,
pursued, and coming to the verge of the land,
Olif and his band took refuge on what seemed
to be a small island. Here they repelled their
pursuers, and soon they saw the channel that
separated them from the mainland widen, and
they thanked their deities for their deliverance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, alas! they soon discovered that they
were on an ice-floe, and were moving north
toward the open sea. Provisions soon gave out,
they prayed to their gods, they floated and
suffered, and as the weaker perished, cannibalism
was resorted to&mdash;for madness possessed
the despairing party. Days and weeks passed,
an impenetrable fog enveloped them, and they
gave themselves up to utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, soon the atmosphere became
milder, the distant breakers were heard, the fog
rose like a curtain, and behold! land was near.
Nearer yet they floated. Night came, the full
moon shone, but it moved not up from, but
along the rim of the horizon. Morning came,
bright and balmy. The floe had entered a
strange harbor, and soon the shores were
reached. It seemed a &lsquo;goodly land&rsquo; with
fertile soil and genial climate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But a remnant of the peaceful tribe of
Olif,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;were saved&mdash;nine men, thirteen
women and five children. They cut boughs and
built an habitation, and they said: &ldquo;This shall
be our dwelling place. Our city shall be called
Eurania, in honor of our lost one, and here we
will tarry until we return to the goddess Oliffa.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This country,&rsquo; said Oseba, &lsquo;was Cavitorus.
These people were the ancestors of my people,
the Shadowas, and on the banks of a charming
harbour they built the City of Eurania, the most
beautiful to-day on this planet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Through all the ages, from barbarism to
the present,&rsquo; said Oseba, &lsquo;there has been a
lingering tale, a faint tradition among the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
as related, and a vague idea that they dwelt in
a shadow, in the hollow of a hand, and that
some time in after ages, or in after life, they
would return to an upper world, called in nursery
tales and by the superstitious, Oliffa, where
the inhabitants are called Outeroos&mdash;because
they dwell on the outer world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Leo Bergin soliloquizes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What astounding folly! and yet, I am on
my way over the limitless fields of ice and snow
and dead men&rsquo;s bones, to this phantom city,
Eurania. Courage! who knows, for&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&lsquo;There are more things in heaven, and earth, Horatio,<br />
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Oseba, &lsquo;these few people were
of an amiable race, and a common danger, and
a common sorrow, had made them brethren.
Then the animals of this country were many,
strong, amiable, and easily tamed; the mountains
were accessible, the climate genial, and
the soil so fruitful that there was nothing to
suggest savagery. All nature smiled, and man
progressed peacefully.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The people,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;increased, they
were prosperous and happy. They had no foes&mdash;so
war was unknown. The animals of the
chase were tamed, and agriculture became an
early occupation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traditions had been broken; back of the
people there were but dead walls. Interminable
ice and snow, as well as time, separated them
from the past. With prosperous industry the
population increased. Colonies were planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
along the interior sea shores, and commerce was
developed. There were no despots to despoil,
no superstition to blight, no wars to devastate,
no idleness to waste, and wealth, such as the
Outeroos never dreamed of, followed as a result.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lands were held for the people, but the
lands were limited, and as the centuries came
and went, and went and came, the population
became very dense. Civilisation and Science
had come, but the population began to press
upon the means of subsistence. Opulent nations
arose, accumulated wealth was great, but room
was becoming scarce. For a time, inventive
genius helped to solve the problem, but the
sorrows multiplied as the struggle was made
more easy. Soon necessities suggested remedies
for growing evils, which not to use meant
universal destruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The population crowded and the weak and
deformed were &lsquo;removed.&rsquo; The remedy was but
tentative, and gradually the pressure grew still
stronger. As the centuries passed, all the weak,
the worthless, and the unfit were sterilised.
The pressure still increased. The State then
provided for taking charge of all the children,
and only the most fit were allowed to become
parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under this policy, and under wise management,
the State became the &lsquo;universal mother.&rsquo;
Parents knew not their offspring, nor the offspring
their parents, and the love of humanity
and public duty became the inspiring motives of
human action. Under this policy, too, have the
leading nations of Cavitorus, with the Shadowas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
in the lead, developed their present civilisation.
Under such a policy they have been able to
adjust the population to the possibilities of the
land, and thus while they have been building
their opulent present, they have developed the
finest type of people mentally, morally and
physically, that ever inhabited this planet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oseba explained the quickness of the soil
in Cavitorus, the length of the seasons and of
the days, with their peculiar irregularities. He
described the movements of the sun, its appearance
at various seasons of the year, and why
it was never entirely dark in those regions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he recited a further tradition, relating
that at the time the people reached Cavitorus,
the bright star Oree was the &lsquo;Pole Star,&rsquo; that it
had moved gradually away, but that in about
twenty thousand years it was to return to its
old position. Further, that on the return of
Oree&mdash;the tradition ran&mdash;the Shadowas would be
released from their seeming isolation, and
be reunited with their brethren of the outer
world to the presence, or on the surface of,
Oliffa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Oseba, &lsquo;in the development
of all people their myths and their heroes
are strongly allied to, if they are not the actual
forces of, Nature, and all have a seasoning of
truth as a basis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The people had watched Oree; were waiting
his return, and were alert for signs of the
coming change, or, as they put it, for a
&ldquo;deliverer.&rdquo; They believed from this tradition,
that they had been in Cavitorus twenty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
years, and a confidence in their future deliverance
was a deep-seated superstition, a real faith
and hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Oree, as seen from the spot where
the first &ldquo;pilgrims landed,&rdquo; as indicated by a
peak on a distant mountain, appeared some
twenty-five years ago, and, as on the very night
the observations were taken a portion of a
wrecked vessel was cast upon our shores, no
wonder the long-deferred hope found expression
in a movement for inquiry and exploration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Later, a tame dog with a brass collar on
his neck was taken from an ice-floe. Later still,
by a few months, a small box and a snow-shoe
drifted ashore. In your year 1890, the corpse
of a white man, clothed in furs, was found
on the beach, and the next morning two bodies
of what are now known to have been Esquimaux,
were found. As we lived on the ocean
front, we knew whence these came. At this
the State took up the work, made an appropriation,
organised a party, and, well,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;they abundantly equipped an expedition,
put me in charge, and I am here on my return
to Cavitorus, after a five years&rsquo; tour, covering
the countries of all the outer globe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>What masterly logic! What skill in the
marshalling of details!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; adds Leo Bergin, soliloquizing, &ldquo;if
it is true, and it must be, for I am going there,
how much stranger than fiction!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The notes continue:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain inquired about the harbors
along the coast of Cavitorus; the Boston man
inquired if there were any gold mines; the
parson, how high the Shadowas built their
church spires; and the engineer, what motive
power was used in their transportation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To these Mr. Oseba answered: &lsquo;I fear,
if I should tell you one half the truth about
these things we should be &ldquo;discovered,&rdquo; to our
sorrow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hour was late, and as all seemed
dazed by the recital, the party dispersed, to
bed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&lsquo;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there&rsquo;s the rub.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>


<h3>BOILING IT DOWN.</h3>

<p>Well, that is rich! Leo had to cut it short,
but he saved me a lot of trouble. Let&rsquo;s see.
Here is a lot of interesting details&mdash;interesting
if life were not so short&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll have to &ldquo;boil
it down,&rdquo; for &ldquo;spice&rdquo; is the word.</p>

<p>The two adventurers left the <i>Irene</i> at Amsterdam,
ran to Hamburg, where they remained
over winter, and being joined by Oseba&rsquo;s fellow-adventurers,
they took a small steamer sent as
a supply ship for a polar party &ldquo;frozen up&rdquo; in
the seas north of Spitzbergen. Disembarking,
they joined a party for the journey further
north, intending to strike the open sea at a
known point. As would be expected, &ldquo;the
cold was intense,&rdquo; but the party was splendidly
equipped, and progress, for polar travel,
was rapid.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="450" height="295" alt="Mitre Peak" />
<p class="center"><i>Mitre Peak, Milford Sound</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oseba,&rdquo; say the notes, &ldquo;had recourse to
a magazine he had supplied for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a><br /><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>on his outward journey. Here were supplies
of condensed food, articles of raiment that bid
defiance to cold, instruments which by reflection
converted light into warmth, and various scientific
appliances, some that practically rendered
the party immune from cold, and others that
aided them in meeting many dangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leo Bergin had not a reputation for underestimating
the trials of any adventure in
which he embarked, but taking all in all, it
seems from his report that, under the lead of
this wizard from &ldquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole,&rdquo; a visit to the
jumping-off place at the north could be made
with little inconvenience or risk to life or health.</p>

<p>Only once in fifty pages of notes does Leo
Bergin complain of hardship. Not once does
he express any regrets, and he never once loses
faith in his master. Only once does he say
&ldquo;the hardships are severe,&rdquo; and then he adds,
&ldquo;but the genius of Oseba has made us so
immune from Nature&rsquo;s blasts, that, on the
main point, we are almost comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were seven of the returning party,
five of the nine friends, who, five years before,
had crossed these frozen plains with Oseba, and
the two &ldquo;star&rdquo; adventurers.</p>

<p>Considering the tales written by North Pole
hunters, the incidents of this journey, from 80°
over the &ldquo;oval&rdquo; or verge, to 60° inside, are
hardly worthy of extensive comment. So I&rsquo;ll
throw the whole journey across these trackless
fields of ice and snow into the waste-paper
basket, or, better still, leave them here, consigned
to more certain oblivion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Had Leo Bergin been a jester, a thousand
richer tales than were ever written by those
who, in search of fame, have joined the throngs
that left their bones in the unknown regions
of the North, could have been found in these
candid notes,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&ldquo;But Truth is a jewel so rich and so rare,<br />
When found should be cherished with martyr-like care.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So I shall metaphorically skip some fifty of Leo
Bergin&rsquo;s pages, and take up the story where
the party arrived in the small but picturesque
harbor, on the shores of which stands the City
of Eurania, the capital of Cavitorus&mdash;just over
the &ldquo;oval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over five long years had passed, since the
sage Oseba, the idol of Cavitorus, and his nine
brave friends had been commissioned to explore
the outer world, in search of truth, in search of
laws or customs by which the Shadowas might
be more wisely guided, or to find a country to
which it might be possible, wise and well, to
send a colony of their children. Four had perished,
and these were to be fittingly mourned;
but &ldquo;the conquering heroes come,&rdquo; and they
were to be fittingly welcomed, and as their approach
had been heralded, thousands of richly-dressed
people thronged the &ldquo;water front,&rdquo; and
the beautiful city was in gala-day attire. The
description of the streets, and fountains, and
parks, and statues of gold, and other eye-ravishing
objects, are dwelt upon in lavish detail,
but &ldquo;want of space,&rdquo; and the love of ease,
admonish me to &ldquo;blue pencil&rdquo; many pages of
this fancy fabric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The superb personality and the gorgeous
attire of the people, amazed the practical Leo
Bergin. I will here venture a quotation, then
again &ldquo;boil it down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The appearance of the people, as they
crowd without confusion along and away back
the shore line, is most striking. They seem
over-tall and very symmetrical in form, and
they move as gracefully as trained actors.
They have finely-chiselled features, deep, rather
large and expressive eyes, slightly bronzed complexions,
and in every curious look, gaze, or expression,
there is an easy, modest dignity, such
as I have never before seen, even among the
rarest few. In every face there is a deep and
real joy; but of enthusiasm, emotionalism, or
sensationalism, there is really none. This passion
of the animal has gone, and the pleasures
of the intellect have re-moulded the countenance.
The face has become the mirror of an
exalted soul. On no countenance is there seen
gravity, on none hilarity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seeing no sadness, I said, &lsquo;Where are the
friends of the four who perished?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! under their system none can know
father or mother, sister or brother, son or
daughter. All are children of the State. In
the success of any one, there can be but a
common joy; in failure, but a common sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What nonsense, to talk of such a society!
People who forget their own children? But
Herbert Spencer tells us of a people among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
whom the men had more affection for the children
of their sisters than for those of their own
wives! Mayhap, Herbert was wrong, for this
seems unnatural. Mayhap, Herbert was right,
for what we call &ldquo;natural&rdquo; is really but custom.
However, &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; there were &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; in
that case&mdash;experience.</p>

<p>Leo continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attire, too, of these people was &lsquo;gorgeous
beyond description.&rsquo; Array all the royalties,
all the nobility, all the Popes and the Cardinals,
with all the courtly favorites and all the Rajahs
and robber chieftains of all the Indies, and all
the flunkies, the fops and the fools of all the
capitals, great and small, of the pretentious
upper world, and marshal them for comparison
in ranks facing these, and they of the upper
world would seem but a pitiable show, or at best
an amusing burlesque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silks and splendid fabrics, not loud and
gay, but rich and rare; jewels resplendent with
Nature&rsquo;s lustre, but worn as modestly as to
seem but articles of common use, were present
in enormous profusion. For jewels, for articles
of personal adornment, for ornaments or trimmings
of wearing apparel, gold was too common,
cheap and vulgar. In carriages, in furniture, in
statuary, in architectural adornments, it was in
use by the ton&mdash;yes, by the cord. Ye gods, if
the Americans knew this!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, as superstition has not blighted,
monopoly has not diverted, despotism has not
robbed, war has not wasted, vice has not
withered, wealth has grown with the ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As our whole party were attired in very
modest European dress, we must have appeared
rather uncouth to the people, but the absence of
apparent curiosity or inquisitiveness, was surprising.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The notes continue:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people must be adepts in electrical
science, for the air was full of &lsquo;floaters,&rsquo; or
flying machines, each seating one or more
persons. They were as thick as blackbirds
in a Missouri cornfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He noticed an entire absence of children
from the throngs of people, but soon an open
space was formed by the crowd falling back,
when several thousand &ldquo;youngsters&rdquo; of both
sexes, and all the tender ages, came marching
down the wharf, in charge of a few modest-looking
superintendents. As they came to a
halt, the people raised their hats in salutation,
when the children, seemingly all of one accord,
bent a knee in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The notes, observations, and running comments
of the observing Leo are worthy of full
perusal, and indeed of preservation, but as I am
hurrying on to a definite purpose, brevity seems
to be a necessity.</p>

<p>The reception of the party by the City
Council and a joint committee from the great
college, of which Leo learned that Amoora
Oseba was the head, was most impressive, and
when the master of ceremonies waved his hand
as a signal, there was an unanimous shout of
&ldquo;Welcome home, Oseba! Welcome back to
Eurania!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the only noisy demonstration.
&ldquo;Every face,&rdquo; says the chronicler, &ldquo;looked
respectful, grateful, gratified, and happy, but
there were no fire-crackers or bad breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is not that marvellous? Think of such a
people! Think of an occasion of like character
in London, New York&mdash;ah, ye gods!&mdash;in
Paris or Berlin! I wonder if this fellow was
not spreading it on rather thick?</p>

<p>But, listen:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were escorted to our carriages, one
hundred gorgeous electro-motors, literally made
of gold and ivory, and adorned with what
appeared to be precious stones, but what proved
to be common, indeed. We were driven to
the temple&mdash;and such a temple! The Palace
of Westminster, the Vatican, or the Washington
Capitol would be &lsquo;nowhere.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I must &ldquo;boil it down.&rdquo; He tells us
that the ceremony at the temple was &ldquo;splendid,
but brief&rdquo;; that the reception of Amoora Oseba
was sincere, and that the proceedings of the
meeting of over five years previous, commissioning
him for the perilous journey, were
read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resolutions of regret&rdquo; for the loss of members
of the party were passed, and a meeting
was appointed at which Amoora Oseba should
make his report to a select committee, and
through such committee to the people of
Eurania and Cavitorus.</p>

<p>Speaking in much praise of the almost
depressing dignity of the ceremony, the notes
record that at the close of the announcement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the chairman read the commission under which
Oseba had acted, and on the performance of
which authorised duty he was to report. It
read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">&ldquo;City of Eurania, Cavitorus,</span><br />
&ldquo;Year 20993, P.C.</p>

<p class="salutation">&ldquo;To the well-beloved Amoora Oseba, Chief, National
Academy of Science.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, the representatives of the State, on behalf of all
the Shadowas, believing that the time is approaching when,
according to our traditions, we are to be reunited with our
brethren of the outer world, and recognising the necessity
of discovering a broader field for the expansion of our race,
hereby authorise you to proceed to the discovery of any
country, to study the condition of any people on this or any
other world, to learn lessons of wisdom whereby we may be
better governed, or &lsquo;spy out&rsquo; a land to which, if possible,
we may desire to send a colony of our surplus population,
and to report at your discretion. The time, the necessary
means, the associates, and all other matters pertaining to
this unique enterprise, will be granted by the State at
your discretion, and may the gods favor your undertaking,
and send you back to us with improved health, increased
knowledge, and hopes that may guide the Shadowas in
their future struggles for social progress.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;Signed by a hundred of the National Committee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>My word! pretty good billet had this
Amoora Oseba. No wonder Leo Bergin was
captivated by the fellow. But that journey
over the &ldquo;oval,&rdquo; as he calls it&mdash;excuse me&mdash;it
makes me shiver.</p>

<p>Well, according to the notes, it&rsquo;s a week
before that meeting takes place, a week to be
thrown away, to wait. Queer, it seems almost
as though I was there. Let&rsquo;s see if there is
anything in his notes to bridge the time.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">

<p>Yes, here he relates what a thrilling adventure
he had in a &ldquo;soar&rdquo; over the fifty-story
houses in an electric air motor; that the
buildings are made of indestructible material;
how their steel does not rust; how light their
machinery; how beautiful the girls. Ah, yes!
And then he says: &ldquo;It might be nice not to
have to &lsquo;ask papa,&rsquo; for here no girl has a
father, a big brother, or a pretty sister&mdash;which
may be convenient.&rdquo; But from the luxury of
a mother-in-law, the Shadowas are forever cut
off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The freedom of association between the
sexes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is surprising, but the social
dignity and decorum are even more surprising.
The country, with every inch cultivated, is
beautiful, and the aspect of Nature, especially
in the night, with the moon sweeping along the
opposite rim of the earth, the sweeping of the
sun along the horizon, the reflection of light
from unknown sources, the wonderful play of
electric phenomena, are too awe-inspiring for
description.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gold is more plentiful than iron is
with us, and platinum more plentiful than
silver;&rdquo; and he accounts for the great quantity
of these heavy metals on scientific theories.
&ldquo;As for diamonds and other precious stones,
it is only a matter of &lsquo;grinding;&rsquo; but the &lsquo;brilliants&rsquo;
are more beautiful than with us, owing
to the peculiarities of the light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What fairy tales! And yet we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;know.&rdquo;
Nature tells some strange stories. Yes, and so do
people. There is something amusing or interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a><br /><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>in the notes of every day, but let the
week slide, for we want to hear the report&mdash;we
want to hear what Amoora Oseba thinks of the
people of the &ldquo;upper crust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Possibly.</p>

<p>Here we come to that great meeting. Let&rsquo;s
get down to date again, and Leo Bergin&rsquo;s notes.</p>

<p>He says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 5em;">&ldquo;Eurania, Cavitorus,</span><br />
&ldquo;October 5th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To-morrow,&rsquo; yes.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The way to dusty death.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow! the great event opens. How
like a dream it all seems. But,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
&ldquo;Dreams in their development have breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tears and tortures, and the touch of joy.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They take a weight from off our waking toils.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">... They speak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like symbols of the future.&rsquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, this dreamy reverie! It brings back
the vanished years, for</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas just one year ago to-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I remember well,&rsquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">when I began this record, at sea, on board the
<span class="smcap">S.S.</span> <i>Irene</i>. I wonder if Sir Marmaduke ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
thinks of me. If he does, he thinks me&mdash;well,
it doesn&rsquo;t much matter now. He was a good
sort, however, and I will never forget him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kind of you, Leo Bergin. By golly! that
fellow has a heart, and a head, too, for that
matter, for he is rarely far wrong. He continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was a generous old soul. Rich,
good-natured and careless, but just. He read
everything, but&mdash;well, perhaps if I had read as
much as he, I would have thought and known
as little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leo Bergin, I swear I had rather you had
forgotten me. That&rsquo;s a nice way to speak of
an absent friend. There is evidently a coolness
between us. Yes, a cool belt, so I will keep my
temper.</p>

<p>Proceed, Leo:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had a note from Venesta to-day, and I
don&rsquo;t know whether it gives me more pleasure
or sadness. Think of courting a girl, who never
had a father or a mother, a sister or a brother!
Daughter of the State! Marry the daughter of
the State! Ye gods, what a mother-in-law!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have idled away the day, and how can
I make amends, save by confession and the
forming of new resolutions? Well,</p>

&ldquo;October 6th.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How balmy the air! How grandly the old
sun sweeps along the rim of this great world!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
For one such scene New York would give
a &lsquo;million,&rsquo; and every eye would dim with
watching the face of the flaming wheel, and
every neck would ache, and every soul would
shudder with awe. But, would not the
Shadowas like to see Old Sol passing over
their heads every twenty-four hours, and give
them three-hundred and sixty-five days during
the year, instead of having him whirl about
their heads, hip high, giving one night seven
months long, and but a hundred and sixty days
of variable length? But it&rsquo;s all in being used
to things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must off to the meeting. I am invited
to the platform, and I shall have plenty to
record this evening, for to-day is nineteen hours
long. Oh, how weird!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later, evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it? I don&rsquo;t know. I
know it was nineteen hours after the old sun
first flitted around Mt. Lena, that it finally
retired, and how can a &lsquo;new chum&rsquo; keep track
of his running on such erratic lines? To make
it more confusing, this is the self same old sun
that mine eyes have been looking upon for, lo!
these thirty wasted years. Who would have
thought that sedate old watchman could ever
play such pranks? Then, too, on the same
little old world! Am I waking? Am I sane,
or is this but a hideous delirium?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel sure that all is unreal, that I am the
sport of some jesting destiny&mdash;but I will play
my part; then, if the vision be not a mockery,
I will not have wasted too much time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What an eventful day! Yet, as long as
it has been, or even seems to have been,
every hour has been crowded with bewildering
incidents&mdash;only bewildering to me, however,
for how unlike the hurry, the confusion, the
bustle, the noise and hilarity seen on such
occasions on the upper crust! How different
from a horse-race in England, an election-day
in France, or a Fourth of July in
America!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a happy, orderly, handsome, and
amiable people, these. Even their Deities are
amiable. Their temples of worship breathe,
not only hope for the future, but appreciation
for the blessings of to-day. With them, it is
not a crown of glory afterwhile, but a living joy.
Without the sorrow of Gautama, the gods of
this under-world are as loving and as amiable.
But why should not the Deities be amiable?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that meeting! The calm dignity of

<p>Yes, Leo, I would like to have been with you,
but, maybe, that would have meant that I would
be with you now, out of the cold, poor fellow!</p>

<p>But here the fellow strings it out as though
our days were also nineteen hours long, and our

a key, that we begin to wonder what there is in
it for him. I will &ldquo;blue pencil.&rdquo; For the once
impatient Leo Bergin has forgotten, I fear, the
customs of this upper world, and that every ear
is attuned to the popular rush.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Pon my word! Leo&rsquo;s &ldquo;borrowed lines&rdquo;
inspire me with a poetic vein. But Leo is
becoming as tedious as an Australian drought, a
West Coast &ldquo;wet spell,&rdquo; or a debate on a
&ldquo;no-confidence motion,&rdquo; so I shall here draw
my critical pencil through many lines. Leo
Bergin is clearness itself, and from his language
there flows, to the intelligent brain, a true conception
of the situation; but for the sake of
brevity&mdash;from vanity, maybe&mdash;I shall condense,
in my own language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, at the appointed time and place the
people assembled. The four-hundred members
of the Council of State occupied favoured seats
in front of the platform, while many thousands
of the citizens filled the stalls and ample
galleries. It was an impressive scene. The
meeting once called to order, &ldquo;Music, such as
heard outside of Eurania or heaven was never,
burst upon the ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s Leo&rsquo;s, but I shall be more prosy and
more brief.</p>

<p>When the last strains of music had died
away, and the applause ceased, the chairman
arose, and after giving a brief but comprehensive
review of the national traditions, the
discoveries and events that led to these
unparalleled adventures, he re-read the commission
under which Amoora Oseba acted, and
impressed upon the audience the importance of
the report from the lips of Eurania&rsquo;s most gifted
son, and the world&rsquo;s most intrepid explorer.</p>

<p>The chairman said, in opening the proceedings,
that while little real attention had
been given to the vague traditions that had
floated down the centuries, there had always
been a feeling among the Shadowas that they
were in a most peculiar situation, and that
science would some time solve the mystery
that seemed to hang over them.</p>

<p>He said, since the dawn of civilisation there
was an &ldquo;absolute knowledge&rdquo; that they were
on the inner surface of a hollow planet, and
there was a vague belief that there were like
beings on the outer surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>He explained that, through the enterprise
of the Council of State, and the intrepidity
of Amoora Oseba and his brave comrades,
that question, the most momentous in the
long history of Cavitorus, it was hoped, had
been solved, and they had met to hear a report
on that most interesting matter.</p>

<p>He said, as the Committee had given the
most careful attention to the books, maps, charts,
and globes brought by the returned party, and
having had the generous assistance of Oseba
himself, and Leo Bergin, a native of the upper
world, they had familiarized themselves somewhat
with the geography, history, customs and
manners of the various nations of the upper
world, by the assistance of the views to be
presented, a fair understanding would be easily
reached. Then, too, as the press had been
generous and enterprising, he thought the
people were quite prepared for an intelligent
appreciation of the gifted traveller&rsquo;s oration.
&ldquo;Mr. Oseba, the father of the new philosophy,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;will now speak to us, as to his
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, as the people had requested that
the poetess Vauline be permitted to ask for
occasional explanations, this was provided for.</p>

<p>Here the record tells us&mdash;I have boiled out
twenty pages of delightful &ldquo;toffy&rdquo;&mdash;that the
chairman introduced Amoora Oseba as: &ldquo;The
most intrepid explorer the world ever knew,&rdquo;
at the same time inviting Leo Bergin and the
other members of the returned party to the
platform.</p>

<p>Of this episode of the ceremony, the modest
Leo Bergin says: &ldquo;I was embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fine canvas, some sixty feet square, had
previously been raised at the end of the hall,
and, with the assistance of attendants, a large
instrument, from which could be thrown moveable
views of the earth&rsquo;s surface, was properly
adjusted. With an explanation all too brief, as
Leo himself thinks, the first picture was thrown
on the wall. It was our planet, represented by
a globe forty feet in diameter, revolving slowly
on its axis. It was a true model of our globe,
on Symmes&rsquo; theory, the angle to the axis
being 23°, with the north opening plainly
visible, and Cavitorus was easily located.</p>

<p>This, we are told, was entirely novel, even
to the Committee; but so skilful are the
mechanics of Eurania, that from a small
model or instrument taken across by the
party, this wonderful piece of complicated
mechanism was perfected.</p>

<p>What a revelation this must have been,
bursting so unexpectedly upon the astonished
gaze of these strange people!</p>

<p>But as in the magic hand of the &ldquo;loved and
lost&rdquo; Leo Bergin there are both pen and brush,
I here invoke his genius, for my pen falters.</p>

<p>He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the vast assembly gazed in almost
breathless awe, the master said: &lsquo;This is
Oliffa, our own planet, as it is hurled through
space at 68,000 miles an hour, with this brief
forty feet expanded to 8,000 miles.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked into the faces of the most intellectual,
the least emotional, and most observing
people I have ever seen, and yet no pen, no
brush, no imagination could reproduce that
scene. Considering the intelligence and the
unemotional character of this vast audience,
the evidence of surprise was really alarming.
For once, these people acted almost like we
fools of the &lsquo;upper crust.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Humph! it makes me crawl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sitting was adjourned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad of it, for it makes me shiver. But it
seems to me, considering the cool intellectuality
of the Shadowas, that Leo Bergin is drawing
that rather long. Let&rsquo;s see! These Shadowas
are a very intellectual, a very thoughtful, a very
cultivated and civilised people. But let us reason
this out. They were utilitarian; amiable as
their environment, and learned, in what was
necessary for their happiness, or within their
reach. Yes, but nine-tenths of the universe&mdash;of
the outer world&mdash;was shut off from them.
They, for 21,000 years, had been on one side&mdash;the
inside&mdash;of a great tube. Practically back
of them, the world lifted abruptly up; front
of them, they could but see above the rim
of the bowl of which they were well toward
the bottom.</p>

<p>The field of observation was narrow, the
visible facts of Nature were few. At the near
opening of the &ldquo;tube&rdquo; there was eternal ice
and snow, an endless expanse of frozen mystery;
while at the other, there could sometimes
be seen many weird clusters of stars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
but, usually, only clouds and storms, and
desert and mountains, and dangerous whirlpools.</p>

<p>They had no telescopes; their point of view
was too narrow for the study of astronomy, and,
as all thoughts, all ideas, all conceptions of all
natural objects must be formed from observation&mdash;from
sensuous impressions&mdash;how could
they draw anything like correct conclusions
regarding the outside worlds? Intellectuality
does not always, if ever, mean universal, or
even very great, knowledge.</p>

<p>Well, then, maybe Leo was even drawing it
mildly. Maybe, a vision so strange, a view of
a known thing from so surprisingly unexpected
a standpoint, at a time, too, when the public
imagination was at a high tension, presenting so
strange a phenomenon, would affect the fine but
impressive mind more than it would the less
thoughtful. Maybe, I say, Leo is right, but it
seems a little lofty.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s back to Leo&rsquo;s notes. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After lunch&rdquo;&mdash;that sounds familiar&mdash;&ldquo;the
meeting recommenced, and the people, having
conversed fully and freely over the matter,
seemed in their normal condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oseba turned the globe slowly, explained
the nature of the earth and of the sun, why the
days were &lsquo;thusly&rsquo;; then the &lsquo;outside&rsquo; conditions,
and why it was not all eternal frost, as
they had imagined. He showed the map of
land and water, how there were on the outside
of our planet, or Oliffa, 1,400,000,000 of people&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
few of them very decent fellows&mdash;and
suggested the enormous importance of communicating
with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he showed a globe, with continents,
islands, seas, rivers, and the geographical
divisions of the land as claimed by nations,
empires, states, and communities, making suitable
remarks, that his impressions might lack
nothing in clearness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He explained that the varied blocks and
patches, distinguished by colored lines, marked
the &lsquo;possessions&rsquo; and claims of various races,
nations, or political communities. He here
described the enormous waste of water, and
mountains, and uninhabitable land, and how
little really desirable country there was on
the outer surface of Oliffa. Yet, he told his
audience that the Outeroos did not dwell in
peace together, but divided the land according
to might, and lived isolated in semi-hostile
communities. &lsquo;These,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are the lands, the
countries, and the peoples I have &ldquo;discovered.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, he said, while the nature and necessity,
the hopes, the aspirations, and the desires of all
men were much the same, there existed on the
outer surface of Oliffa such a variety in customs
and manners adopted for the accomplishment
of desired ends, that only by a visit
to, and a study of, all countries, could the
object of his mission be fulfilled, so for five
years he and his companions had wandered,
observed, and taken notes, and now it was only
by reviewing the situation with some detail that
an intelligent understanding could be conveyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he pointed out on the maps the
localities of the various countries, briefly describing
the climate, soil, and style of government
in general, and said he would now discuss
a little more fully the merits of the various
countries and peoples&mdash;with his conclusions
from the inquiry&mdash;for his discoveries had been
important and many.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He reminded his audience of the prime purpose.
His mission was to gain from the outer
world a knowledge that might aid them in the
better management of their domestic affairs; to
discover, if possible, a country to which they
might send a colony of the surplus population,
and to find a people with whom they could
open communications, that they might become
co-workers to the mutual happiness of the
newer and the older inhabitants of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oseba,&rdquo; says the record, &ldquo;re-arranged his
instruments, saying that he would show us, as
occasion required, the globe as a whole or a
sectional map. He would begin his review with
a country, probably the oldest settled, and certainly
the most populous, on the outer surface of
Oliffa&mdash;that of the Chinese Empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, I may remark that I have carefully
studied the notes of poor Leo Bergin. They
are full, carefully revised, and show a masterly
understanding of the situation, but they are too
copious for even extensive quotation. From
many closely and well-written pages, the notes
report Oseba&rsquo;s orations, with hardly a break or
comment. For the sake of brevity, I shall
appropriate Oseba&rsquo;s story, and, save by a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
pointed quotations, I shall use my own language
in the review of the next scene. I realise that
by this method the story will be marred, the
language will be less picturesque and expressive,
and probably less correct, but it will be economy
of space, and, what is of importance to me,
&ldquo;economy&rdquo; in the expenditure of intellectual
force. That is worthy of consideration!</p>

<p>The imaginative Leo seemed to be absorbed
in the changing scenes of the unique situation.
During a lull in the proceedings he notes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How like a dream! Oh, my soul, how
I do hope!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, probably being again confronted by
that &ldquo;if,&rdquo; he seems to hang his head, halt, and
ponder, for he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hopes, like joys and promising children,
grow into regrets, or wither and die.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SCENE_IV" id="SCENE_IV"></a><i>SCENE IV.</i></h2>

<h3>FIRST &ldquo;DISCOVERY.&rdquo;</h3>


<h3>SIZING UP AH SIN, AND LU.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> sage Oseba, after locating China on the
globe, threw a view of the map of the
Empire on the wall. He explained that
this country &ldquo;embraced&rdquo; 4,000,000 square miles
of the surface of Oliffa, and contained about
400,000,000 &ldquo;souls,&rdquo; or nearly one-third of all
the Outeroos. But this includes the Mandarins,
who are not supposed to have &ldquo;souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With amusing speech, he reviewed the history,
the social, political, and industrial conditions
of this &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; people.</p>

<p>It was in China that Oseba became first
acquainted with the aggressiveness, the pretentiousness,
and the real power of the European
or Occidental Nations. As a race, these
&ldquo;foreign devils&rdquo; were taller in stature, stronger
of limb, and lighter in complexion, and they
had better opinions of themselves than the
Orientals. Conceit is a strong factor in all
these mighty games.</p>

<p>The clergymen, or missionaries, were among
his first acquaintances from over the seas.</p>

<p>A mischievous consular clerk, he says, who
seemed to have a grievance, used to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
&ldquo;They came in shoals,<br />
To save the souls,<br />
Of Hop, Lee, Sing, and Wu.<br />
They gathered gear,<br />
Both far and near,<br />
As you or I would do.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>These &ldquo;solemn men,&rdquo; as Oseba called
them, apologising for the digression, came first
of their countrymen, not for &ldquo;filthy lucre,&rdquo; but
to &ldquo;save all the sons of Confucius and to
take them to Heaven, where, together, they
could sing and associate forever, and forever,
and forever.&rdquo; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;seemed
kind of them,&rdquo; but he soon learned that the
nations who sent these agents to prepare the
social situation for &ldquo;the sweet by-and-bye,&rdquo; were
&ldquo;not at home,&rdquo; to Hop, Lee, Sing, or Wu,
during their brief stay on the surface of
Oliffa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We love you,&rdquo; said the genteel agents of a
hundred disputing creeds, &ldquo;go with us to a land
that is better than day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Velly well,&rdquo; says Hop, Lee, Sing, and Wu,
&ldquo;we likely go &rsquo;Melica.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; says the good shepherd,
&ldquo;afterwhile, in the sweet by-and-bye. &rsquo;Tis of
a better world we speak&mdash;patience, meekness,
and love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked the poetess Vauline, &ldquo;are the
other Outeroos not &lsquo;at home&rsquo; to the Chinese
while they are quite alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a smile, Oseba said, &ldquo;The Chinese,
my children, are very industrious and frugal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they an inferior race?&rdquo; asked the
poetess Vauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are &lsquo;different,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;but
every race, people, nation, tribe, or creed on
Oliffa, thinks itself &lsquo;superior&rsquo; to any and all
others. Vanity is absent&mdash;with few of the
Outeroos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At considerable length, he reviewed the
political, social, and industrial situation of
China, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the outer world might learn lessons
of patient industry from China, but for us,
there is nothing in China.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a brief review of the social and
political situation of each, he dismissed all
the countries of Continental Asia, but he said
Hongkong and Singapore, two of the world&rsquo;s
modern wonders, had done much to apprise
the world of the hidden treasures in these
Tartarean regions.</p>

<p>He drew attention to his discovery of Japan,
as it appeared on the map with Asia, and then
removing this, he threw the globe on the canvas.
He dwelt in almost raptures on the beauty of
the country he was now to examine. Of the
Japanese, of whose condition he would first
inquire, he said they had an old history. They
had been isolated for many centuries. They
dreamed in their narrow world, played in their
little backyards, worshipped their monarch, and
had been happy; but recently, touched by the
magic wand of modern civilisation, they aroused,
and having for a brief spell cast about them,
they &ldquo;girded up their loins&rdquo;&mdash;tightened their
belts&mdash;and hurried to join the front ranks of the
army of progress, with an enthusiasm, and even
a wisdom, never before known on this little
globe.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="450" height="298" alt="Cathedral Peaks" />
<p class="center"><i>Cathedral Peaks, Lake Manapouri</i></p>
</div>

<p>Once aroused by the exhilarating thrill of
progress, they as readily adjusted themselves to
the peculiar conditions of their natural environments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a><br /><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>as children to a new playground. The
mountains suggest liberty, the seas adventure,
and to the fearless adventurers of those inhabiting
the indented shores of the water-front,
are the Outeroos indebted for all the blessings
of modern progress&mdash;for civilisation is the
ripened fruit of ocean commerce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the sage Oseba, &ldquo;the present
42,000,000 Japs have but 147,000 square miles
of dirt, half of which is waste. Under the
delirium of modern conditions the population
is rapidly increasing, and thus are the inhabitants
already beginning to crowd each other.
The nation is becoming wealthy, while the
people are becoming poor. The real estate
on little Oliffa is already staked out, and conspicuously
adorned with that strange device&mdash;&lsquo;keep
off the grass.&rsquo; There is no vacant corner
for the surplus population, my children, and the
Japs are land animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sage Oseba told his audience that
&ldquo;Many nations among the Outeroos regarded
the &lsquo;Japs&rsquo; as an &lsquo;inferior race,&rsquo; but if the
achievements of man is the measure of the soul
and the intellect, the Japs have no superiors on
little Oliffa, for her recent progress pales the
lustre of the world&rsquo;s authentic history; but,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&lsquo;If the zenith of strife, sheds a mystical lore,<br />
And coming events cast their shadows before,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">said the sage, as he tortured the immortal
Thomas, the brilliancy of Japanese story
may soon wane, and as, owing to lack of
room, her only path to glory is through unfashionable
war, the prospects are not rosy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Though that nation may, for a long time, remain
flamboyant, the people may soon writhe in a
lower misery than &lsquo;pagan Japan&rsquo; ever knew.</p>

<p>However, should the little brown man clip
the claws from the Russian bear, and send him
back, lame and growling, to his northern lair,
and then arouse China, and, by the skill
of his wonderful capacity, organize it, Eastern
Asia may remember a few thousands of the
&ldquo;insults&rdquo; heaped upon her people during the
last half-century, and conclude to test the question
of &ldquo;superiority&rdquo; by other than industrial
methods.</p>

<p>Of the known Monarchies of Asia, he said,
the people were ignorant and impoverished, the
officials were insolent and corrupt, the rulers
were vicious and despotic, and the governments
rotten beyond cure.</p>

<p>As to India, the sage Oseba spoke with
sympathy. &ldquo;Britain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the only
country capable of governing an &lsquo;inferior&rsquo; race.
She has done much to rescue the country from
periodic, if not from almost constant war, and
famine, and despair; but the &lsquo;people,&rsquo; the offspring
of thousands of years of misrule and
oppression, have reached a condition of crystallized
non-progressiveness, and they must
finally die out, as they cannot adjust themselves
to modern conditions. Its past is sad,
its future is hopeless. It will long be a country
in which a few cunning bees may load themselves
with golden honey, that their far away
hives may be filled; but slowly and sadly that
strange brown people must pass away. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
have reached their ultimate. In them the oak
and the steel, necessary for the contests of the
future, are wanting.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>EUROPE, SOMEWHAT &ldquo;DISCOVERED.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The globe was so adjusted as to give a
perfect view of the Continent of Europe, and,
in interesting speech, were the countries and
their peoples described.</p>

<p>Referring to the influence of environment,
the orator explained how the comparative
smallness of this continent, the fertility of the
soil, the variety of plant and animal life, the
mountains, and plains, and indented shore lines,
with enormous stretch of water-front, together
with its extensive river systems and healthful,
but erratic climatic conditions, marked this as
the garden and nursery for the most active,
sturdy, intelligent, and emotional of all peoples
on the globe.</p>

<p>Continental Europe covers an area of
3,500,000 square miles, and supports, in
various degrees of opulence and wretchedness,
some 380,000,000 people&mdash;chiefly men,
women, and clergymen&mdash;with 20,000,000 men in
&ldquo;uniform,&rdquo; who seem well seized with their own
importance. These latter are very influential
personages, as they are equipped with very
persuasive arguments.</p>

<p>The orator explained that the many-hued
and irregular patches on the map represented
the possessions and the rule, of as many
nations, all of whom had good opinions of themselves,
and stood ready to back their pretensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>These countries were ruled by persons who
were fortunate in the selection of parents, or
who, at least, were furnished with proper birth
certificates.</p>

<p>But with her many governments and
nationalities, he said, there was constant confusion.
There were fear and oppression, for all
these imaginary lines had to be guarded. The
armies had to be kept up; the 5,000,000 soldiers
must be in constant readiness for slaughter,
for only by this means could the people be
sufficiently impressed with the validity of the
birth certificate.</p>

<p>Asked by the poetess Vauline, what these
so-called soldiers did for a living, Mr. Oseba
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They kill folks, for, short as are the lives of
the Outeroos among the superior nations, wholesale
murder is the most honored of all pursuits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oseba said: &ldquo;All the civilised nations keep
these armed men, whose duty it is to kill somebody&mdash;to
whom they may never have been introduced&mdash;when
their ruler has a grievance, and
has no time to attend to the matter himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These armies, too, are potent in diplomatic
controversies. When a monarch has a little
misunderstanding with one of his class from
a neighboring paddock, he says in deep
tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sire, these are the facts, and if you don&rsquo;t
believe it, Sire, look!&rsquo;&mdash;and he points to his
ready battalions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To a people who never knew of war or
poverty&mdash;among whom probably not one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
would care to be killed, or could find a person
to accommodate him if he should, these statements
seemed most amazing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba concluded, from the conspicuousness
of military show, that every toiler in
Europe carried a soldier on his back. And
worse&mdash;he had to feed him, to clothe him, to
pay him, and then to constantly submit to his
insolence. From every home and fireside in
Europe the most sturdy supporter, and the best
loved one, was taken for target practice; and
the burden imposed upon industry for showy
barbarism, was crushing the whole of Europe
and driving the people into revolution, anarchy
and ruin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; said the poetess Vauline, &ldquo;are
you speaking of the superior, the Christian or
civilised peoples?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said the Sage, &ldquo;for only the
Christian nations could enjoy, and only the
superior nations could afford such heroic entertainments.
As a fact, the size of the army and
range of the gun are the true tests of a
country&rsquo;s civilisation and &lsquo;superiority.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange, my children, but the &lsquo;superior&rsquo;
peoples, those worshipping Him who said, &lsquo;Thou
shalt not kill,&rsquo; have the longest guns, and the
strongest battalions, and they are most ready to
kill on the least provocation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The audience, say the notes, was most
impressed when told that these arguments&mdash;loaded&mdash;were
aimed by the most
civilised nations at each other. Oseba continues:&mdash;&ldquo;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
guns and the military show, help to
amuse the people; they regulate home prices,
and guard the dignity of the managers. They
are practically the &lsquo;keep off the grass&rsquo; notice;
but, as a fact, my children, they are kept to-day
more to overawe the people who pay the bills
than to ward off any external danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is a marked difference between
the Oriental and the Occidental. The Oriental
is selfish&mdash;he wants peace, and is indifferent to
the fate of others. The Oriental don&rsquo;t care what
a man believes, or what god he worships, so long
as he pays the liken, and moves on; while the
superior races are deeply concerned about the
soul, and they want to discover all other people,
and get them to join them&mdash;afterwhile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As social units, the Occidentals are more
progressive and free, but less secure; they are
more sympathetic, but less just; more interested
in others, but less tolerant; and more inclined
to action, and less to meditation than the
Orientals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While there is a vast difference in the
degree of oppression in Continental Europe,
between class assumption, military despotism,
official insolence, and creed interference, save
for those for whom custom would render hell
salubrious, there is no room for a liberty-loving
man&mdash;especially is it no place for a
people with the lofty aspirations of the
Shadowas. But, oh, the poverty, the misery,
the humiliating sorrow! Oh, my children!
If the faith of those pretentious mortals be
not folly, if there be somewhere an all-powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
God of Love and Justice, if kneeling at His
throne there be hosts of saints and angels,
who behold the bloody conflicts, see the
widow&rsquo;s tears and the agonizing gasp of
want; who hear the sighs of the over-worked
slave, the groans of poverty and the prayers
that go up to heaven from the white lips of
innocence, let the Shadowas implore the masters
of Europe&rsquo;s millions to grant mercy, or the
beseeching hearts of heaven will break, and
the tears of the angels will drown the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, like Uphus swinging the doors to
welcome the dawn of a new day, we turn to
more pleasing scenes.</p>

<h2><a name="SCENE_V" id="SCENE_V"></a><i>SCENE V.</i></h2>

<h3>THE BRITISH ISLES DISCOVERED.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">At</span> this stage of the proceedings the Sage
Oseba seemed to be in fine form and in
most cheerful spirits.</p>

<p>He remarked that he was now to give his
people a brief view of the &ldquo;Country of
Countries,&rdquo; an island region, just off the
humming hive of uniformed Europe. Here the
globe revolved until the British Isles were
conspicuously in view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;of all the fertile dirt
on the surface of Oliffa, is the most interesting.
This, among the countries of the Outeroos, is
the classic land of liberty, the sheet-anchor of
Europe for more than three hundred years.
These rock-bound Isles, with a fertile soil,
a salubrious climate, indented shores&mdash;fortunately
placed geographically&mdash;are by nature the
best suited for the development of the ideal
man of any spot on the surface of Oliffa, and
having been peopled by sturdy tribes, all the
suggestive hopes of Nature have been realised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told his people that the British Isles
embraced 124,000 square miles, and contained
40,000,000 inhabitants; and that, on these few
acres, there were more muscle and brain, and
intellectual force and stubbornness and haughty
pretension, than on any other spot of like
dimensions on the surface of Oliffa.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="450" height="347" alt="Mount Egmont" />
<p class="center"><i>Mount Egmont.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;These sturdy Britons, my children, who
have resistlessly held these historic Islands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a><br /><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>against all comers for many centuries, have
done more to elevate, to educate, to emancipate,
to civilise and to unite humanity; to free the
brain from superstition, the limbs from fetters,
and the world from bondage, than any other
nation or race that ever inscribed its achievements
on the pages of human history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Britain, my children, has conquered
many foes, but her chief glory has been
her conquests in the arts of peace. She has
conquered climate, and famine, and pestilence,
and the idolatry that would crucify the new
upon the mouldering cross of the old régime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Britain has given Oliffa its industrial and
commercial methods, the tone of its present
civilisation, and she is rapidly giving to the
whole race her erstwhile scorned language, and
in this there seems a magic spell that infects all
who imbibe its spirit with a burning desire for
liberty. To lisp the English tongue, is to feel&mdash;a
king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you a little story, my
children, of the most interesting, the most
wonderful&mdash;yes, even the most marvellous
of all the doings of man on this most erratic
little planet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These British Isles are separated from the
Continent of Europe by a damp streak, and
they are inhabited by the mixed offspring of a
dozen sturdy and virile tribes, all from the
northern water-front. All these virile tribes,
whether natives or invaders, were strongly imbued
with the spirit of liberty&mdash;as they understood
it. They loved peace&mdash;if they had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
fight for it. They loved liberty&mdash;to squeeze the
other fellow. But in the fibre of these people
there was a sublime stubbornness that often
made things awkward for the authorities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody wanted to boss, so nobody
would wear the collar. Everybody wanted
to be free, but the feeling was so unanimous
that there was abundance of officers but
no privates, so it took many centuries of disputes,
and quarrels, and conflicts, and wars,
before they had accumulated sufficient &lsquo;grey
matter&rsquo; to comprehend the fact that civilised
government is a compromise; that where any
can be oppressed, none can be secure; and
that liberty, which must halt at the gate of the
other fellow&rsquo;s paddock, is the inalienable right
of man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the British can learn, and they have
so well mastered this problem that the highest
now yield the most ready obedience to the law,
and the strongest most readily defend the rights
of the weak. Though it took Britain, with her
sturdy conceit, centuries to learn this, and
though she, by her fibre and her position as
a coloniser, was the legitimate successor of
Ph&oelig;nicia and Greece, she was rather backward
about coming forward, for after the discovery
of America, when all the other nations
were madly participating in western exploits, she
stood aloof for over a hundred years to complete
her preparations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she came with a lunch basket, she
came with both feet, she came to stay, and her
achievements find no parallel in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
human progress. Before she opened her foreign
real estate office, the new world had been parcelled
out. Others had staked their claims&mdash;many
over-lapping&mdash;and there were plentiful notices to
&lsquo;keep off the grass,&rsquo; but she was undaunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1607 she planted her first colony in
America. Soon there were thirteen&mdash;an unlucky
number&mdash;then she foolishly taxed them into
revolt, and here she learned a valuable lesson.
Since then, she has never oppressed a colony;
since then, she has never taken one backward
step; since then, she has gradually extended her
beneficent hand over the earth, until over one-fifth
of the land is painted red&mdash;her favorite hue&mdash;and
over one-fourth of the human race bow a
willing allegiance to her flag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says Leo&rsquo;s notes, &ldquo;would not that
please dear old Sir Marmaduke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;America, my children, of which I shall
soon speak, was Britain&rsquo;s noblest contribution
to human progress, for though the two nations
have moved under different colours for more
than a century, their mutual enterprise has
revolutionised the industrial world, and brought
humanity in touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marvel of marvels! When other nations,
now in business, boasted of world-conquest, the
British were but a &lsquo;handful,&rsquo; inhabiting these
rock-bound islands, but as mountains suggest
freedom and seas adventure, looking over the
waters, her daring sons went forth&mdash;not to
conquer, not to exploit or to devastate, but to
develop the world, and to build homes, and
colonies, and states, and empires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If Britain took a gun in her outings&mdash;and
she often did&mdash;it was to level a place for a
home, a shop, or a factory. Where she plants
her feet the soil becomes more fertile, and when
she meets a savage, he stands more proudly
erect&mdash;after the first few sermons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the motherland of America, and, by
mutual efforts, the two have become the paragons
of civilised progress. She saved old India from
the rajahs, robbers, and priests, from famine
and pestilence, and made it a paradise&mdash;as
compared with its former condition. She saved
strange, beloved, dreamy, half-mythical old
Egypt from rot and ruin, and made it a marvel
of hope and progress. She is saving &lsquo;Darkest
Africa&rsquo; from slavery, superstition, and fratricidal
war; and, with diamonds on its golden clasps,
she is handing it over to civilisation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave to civilisation Canada, with its
splendid people, its fertile fields, and its stupendous
&lsquo;ice-plant&rsquo;; and she gave to civilisation
the seven colonies of Australasia, with the
most wealthy, the most commercial, the most
progressive, the most advanced, educated,
civilised, and free people on the whole outer
surface of the planet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, to show her small respect for dirt,
save as a place to fasten down upon&mdash;and her
marvellous ambition for industrial development&mdash;behold!
the modern commercial wonders,
Hongkong and Singapore! Many nations complain
of &lsquo;Britain&rsquo;s land-greed,&rsquo; and that John
Bull&mdash;as these sturdy Britons are lovingly
called&mdash;always carries a bucket and a brush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and is everywhere painting the world red; but
wherever the carmine shines, liberty and progress
are assured. Every inch of soil wrested
from darkness by British valour is handed over
to civilisation&mdash;free to all comers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, marvel of marvels, my children! In
her more than a hundred wars&mdash;save by her
mistake in striving to coerce her own children in
America&mdash;she has never lost an inch of
important dirt by force. And, more glorious
still, every inch won from barbarism by her
blood and valor, has been handed over to
civilisation and human progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, no! She won much in war, which, to
the infinite loss of the world, she gave back in
peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She took Cuba in war, restored order, and
gave it back in peace. Better for the world had
she kept it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She took by war, and gave back in peace,
the Philippines, Cape Colony, Java, Sumatra,
Senegal, Pondicheri, and more than twenty
other valuable possessions, all to the loss of the
world&mdash;and yet she has been accused of territorial
avarice&mdash;of &lsquo;land hunger.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right! Mr. Oseba, and had the politicians
in Downing Street properly backed the
sturdy British wanderers, most of Oliffa would
have been painted red and done up in a shawl
strap long ere this, and the Brito-Yankee
race would have been in a position to guarantee
peace among all nations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my children,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there are
often sombre linings to many resplendent clouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and lest you may all conclude to rush out of
Cavitorus to these wonderful islands, I must
show you a few of the less attractive pictures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, that for modern civilisation
among the Outeroos, the world is indebted to
the colonial enterprise and success of Britain;
but remember, too, that it is not always the
&lsquo;colonising nations,&rsquo; but the &lsquo;colonists&rsquo; of the
&lsquo;colonising nations,&rsquo; that carry the standard
of social progress to advanced grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The basis of modern colonial success,
was, of course, in the fibre of the British
race; but for the resistlessness of British
colonial enterprise much was due to flagrant
faults in Britain&rsquo;s domestic policy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are land animals&mdash;we live on, and from
the land, and Britain had but 124,000 square
miles of dirt. &lsquo;Room&rsquo; was scarce, so people
had a &lsquo;far-away look.&rsquo; But worse, a very few
in the Motherland &lsquo;owned&rsquo; most all this meagre
surface, so people saw opportunity only in a
change&mdash;for a deep love of liberty forced the
evils of monopoly upon their attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well these sturdy Britons, with the mixed
blood of the rugged Danes, Jutes, Celts,
Saxons, Angles and others did not feel at home
as guests, serfs or tenants, so they began to
roam around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The orator said he would present a few little
&ldquo;reasons&rdquo; why the Shadowas would not care
to &ldquo;flock&rdquo; to the British Isles, and also a
review of conditions that might have had some
influence in arousing the spirit of foreign
adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They discovered,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that of the
76,000,000 acres of dirt on the whole British
Isles, one man&mdash;great only in his possessions&mdash;owned
1,350,000 acres, while another owned
460,000 acres, the two being the born owners of
over 2 per cent. of the whole, upon which
40,000,000 men were compelled to live.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They found that about two hundred
families owned about half of all the land;
that less than one per cent. of the people
owned over 99 per cent. of the land, and that
more than 90 per cent. of the people were
absolutely landless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is amusing, my children, to hear these
sturdy British boast about &lsquo;my country,&rsquo;
when a few families own so much of all
the land on which all must live&mdash;if they
remain at home. But observing the enormous
power enjoyed by the holders of vast estates in
the old world, too many sought by cornering the
lands, to acquire like advantages in the new,
and in the correction of this ancient error, the
best statesmanship of the age is still required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba proceeded to explain that as
from many seemingly indefensible situations
beneficent results often arise, it could hardly be
doubted that the inherited curse of British
landlordism has, in a most imposing &ldquo;disguise,&rdquo;
been a &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; to civilisation.</p>

<p>It impressed the thoughtful &ldquo;subject&rdquo; with
the incomparable importance of the land to
life itself, especially when population began to
crowd; and it forced upon the attention, even
of the thoughtless, the enormous influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and real power wielded by the possessors of
large estates. The class inequalities that arose
through the inheritance by the few of the source
from which all must live, drove hosts of the
most intelligent, sturdy, and self-reliant of the
people to distant countries, and determined
them to provide in the new home against the
evils that had expelled them from the old.</p>

</div>

<p>As these emigrants loved the Motherland,
they desired to remain loyal; as they had
learned the advantages of land holdings, each
desired to secure his own home; but remembering
the past, they sought to provide that the
limits of each to live from another&rsquo;s toil should
be narrowed. Not by violating the rights of
property &ldquo;owners,&rdquo; but by securing the rights
of property &ldquo;creators,&rdquo; were new ideas popularised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these inheriting world-owners,&rdquo; said
the orator, &ldquo;as a rule, have a pretty good time,
though none of them have been permitted to
remain long enough on their particular slice
of Oliffa for it to get stale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reluctant to leave Britain, but anxious to
pick up some of her wandering children, he
closes our mother&rsquo;s case with this fond caress:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While these people of Britain are the salt
of the earth, it is the offspring, and not the
land-owner, who is to lead in the future social
contests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it, it is not &lsquo;Britain,&rsquo; but
the &lsquo;Briton,&rsquo; that, like Atlas, carries the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>on his shoulders; and &rsquo;tis the &lsquo;Briton&rsquo; who is
the &lsquo;salt of the earth,&rsquo; while &lsquo;Britain&rsquo; is the
salt mine.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>&ldquo;DARKEST AFRICA&rdquo; FINALLY DISCOVERED.</h3>

<p>Oseba then turned his instruments on Africa.
He told his audience that while along the fringe
of this half-mythical land there were glimpses
of a very ancient movement, the vast interior,
until almost yesterday, was a veritable <i>terra
incognito</i>, and to-day it is not easy to separate
the grain of truth concerning its history from
the cartload of fiction.</p>

<p>But Britain was now rolling up the sombre
curtain, and opening the doors of her fabulous
treasure-house that the &ldquo;grateful&rdquo; (?) nations
might enter and take rooms.</p>

<p>Africa, the sage told his audience, covered
one-fifth of the land surface of the outer globe,
and had a population of 150,000,000 souls, or
more than live in all the Americas and their
islands. It has a doubtful history, thousands
of years old. It was once so &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; that
it housed three-hundred Christian Bishops, yet,
to-day there is but a small portion&mdash;the Cape&mdash;that
can claim more than a mere introduction
to modern civilisation.</p>

<p>The orator informed the people, as he threw
a series of pictures on the canvas, that many of
the European nations were striving to extend
their borders in Africa, and to the sorrow of the
natives, they were now being pretty generally
&ldquo;discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>


<h3>HUMAN RIGHTS.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent epigraph">Oh! sacred rights of man, ordained of God, yet only
won by blood, and tears, and toil.</p>
</div>

<p>Here there was a digression, and an essay on
&ldquo;the rights of man,&rdquo; for the poetess Vauline
inquired by what &ldquo;right&rdquo; the Europeans were
&ldquo;portioning out Africa,&rdquo; if that country had
already 150,000,000 people?</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the sage Oseba, as he moved
his eyes from his admiring critic to his audience,
&ldquo;this is a pertinent question; but remember,
my children, most of the inhabitants of Africa
are black&mdash;they are very black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is that an answer to my question?&rdquo;
said the poetess Vauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;it would be so deemed
among the Outeroos, for questions of right and
wrong do not apply to people who are unbleached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This created great surprise, for the
Shadowas had not gone entirely through
the bleaching process.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why, among so-called civilised people,
have the blacks no rights?&rdquo; said the poetess
Vauline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plain enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Oseba, &ldquo;for black
people have no blunderbusses, and among the
most civilised Outeroos &lsquo;rights&rsquo; are measured
by the carrying power of the guns and the
skill of the men behind them. Among all the
&lsquo;civilised nations&rsquo; on Oliffa &lsquo;right&rsquo; is measured,
not by the pleadings of the master, not by the
demands of humanity or justice, but in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
instance by color, for this indicates the capacity
of the blunderbusses, and the nerve of the
gunner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yellow have rather more rights than
black people, for they sometimes have a few
guns and some saltpetre. &lsquo;Thou shalt not
kill&rsquo; and &lsquo;Thou shalt not steal&rsquo; apply only
to white men; and even then, only to
small neighborhoods or in police affairs, for
&lsquo;nations&rsquo; are above these honeyed ravings,
and expediency, not right, becomes the patriotic
guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my children, as John Bull is rapidly
painting Africa red, we will preserve an open
mind regarding that much-talked-of and little
known country, though for the present it is no
place for saints or Shadowas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may say, in referring to colour in the
discussion of questions of right, that &lsquo;red&rsquo;
is considerably respected. Then, too, of recent
years, with improved tastes among the nations,
&lsquo;red, white and blue,&rsquo; thusly arranged is quite
respected, while &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; is very unfashionable,
and &lsquo;green&rsquo; is mostly admired when in
uniform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That black Africa will, ere long, be about
all red, about all British&mdash;at least in language,
in sentiment, in human sympathy, in social, industrial
and political methods and aspiration, if
not in allegiance&mdash;can hardly be doubted; and
as her ideals alone of all the races on the upper
crust would satisfy us, our children may hope
for further communication with these British-African
colonies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>


<h3>SPANISH AMERICA &ldquo;DISCOVERED.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The orator here hesitated, then threw the
map of what he termed &ldquo;Spanish America&rdquo; on
the screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, my children,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Spanish
America, with an area&mdash;including Central
America and Mexico&mdash;of over 8,000,000
square miles, and a population of about
50,000,000 souls. This is a &lsquo;new&rsquo; country,
called &lsquo;new&rsquo; by the Outeroos because it had
been little improved since the old occupiers
were blessed and sent to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The orator claimed that, in forest, in soil,
in mineral wealth, and in all the resources
of Nature necessary to the subsistence of a
great population, South was probably superior
to North America; yet, behold the mighty difference!
The world had never presented so
conspicuous an opportunity for weighing the
merits of different races as colonisers and
civilisers as are shown in the present conditions
of South and North America, and all
these marvellous disparities lie in the character
of the invading or colonising races.</p>

<p>North America sprang from the loins of
Britain; South, from the loins of Spain. That
tells the story. But a comparison in all the late
colonial enterprises of the world, shows Britain
to hold an equally favorable position, for of all
the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; dependencies of all the other
nations of the globe, there is not one that
enjoys a sufficient degree of liberty and social
progress to render it self-supporting&mdash;possibly,
save Java, held by the Dutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>The 50,000,000 Spanish-Americans, he
observes, write less than one-half the number
of letters written by 5,000,000 Canadians, and
they have less commerce than 4,500,000
Australians, and less newspapers than 800,000
New Zealanders&mdash;and education and commerce
means civilisation.</p>

<h3>A TEMPEST.</h3>

<p>Here the sage amusingly described a
Spanish-American revolution.</p>

<p>He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the young men of any city become
weary with the more common excitements, the
theatre and the bullfight, they organise a
&lsquo;revolution.&rsquo; For this &lsquo;outing&rsquo; they call
together their friends, arm themselves, establish
a camp on the outlying hills, and make ready for
&lsquo;slaughter.&rsquo; The &lsquo;loyalists&rsquo;&mdash;salaried clerks
usually, with a few hangers-on&mdash;rush out to
meet the belligerents, and approach to within a
reasonably safe distance, when both sides &lsquo;fall
in,&rsquo; fire simultaneously&mdash;each over the others&rsquo;
heads&mdash;when all break and run for the treasury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the &lsquo;loyalists&rsquo; win the race they vote
themselves extra pay, smoke a cigar, and enjoy
a <i>siesta</i>; while if the others win, the treasury
is looted, a new set of clerks installed, the taxes
are raised to repair the damages, and the new
&lsquo;push&rsquo; enjoy the <i>siesta</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The security of the public from too frequent
changes rests in the fact that usually the
camp of the &lsquo;loyalists&rsquo; is taken up between that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
of the insurgents and the treasury, so the
&lsquo;loyalists&rsquo; have a shorter run to make in the
home stretch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think, my children, what civilisation would
have been to-day had the British been content
to remain on their Island home, or had both
the Americas been permanently held by the
Spanish race&mdash;or, to judge by later history, by
any other than the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my friends, I have no interest in
booming any country, but if I had owned all
Spanish-America in &lsquo;fee simple,&rsquo; and had a long
lease on Hades, I would rent my freehold out,
and reside on my other holding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Leo remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, for a laugh with Sir
Marmaduke.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the sage, &ldquo;there is nothing
worthy of imitation in Spanish-America, and
there is no room under the present rule in these
countries for the staid virtues of the Shadowas.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SCENE_VI" id="SCENE_VI"></a><i>SCENE VI.</i></h2>

<h3>AMERICA &ldquo;DISCOVERED.&rdquo;</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Oseba</span> said he was now to return to rather
favourite pastures. He was now to review
the situation of a country unanimously
admitted, by all its millions of proud and
patriotic people, to be the &ldquo;greatest country,&rdquo;
not only on this earth, but in the Universe&mdash;and
this, of course, meant America.</p>

<p>Leo Bergin, having been born in America,
seemed to be &ldquo;at home&rdquo; to these graceful compliments.</p>

<p>Oseba said that before he reached America,
that country had been somewhat &ldquo;discovered&rdquo;
by a Mr. Morgan, who had much of it done up
in a shawl strap, but that it was still considerably
in business.</p>

<p>This American nation, he said, sprang
from the loins of Britain, and its founders had
inherited their fibre from that &ldquo;classic land of
liberty.&rdquo; Being strongly imbued with the
British spirit, and being impressed by their
novel surroundings, they broke the thread of
tradition, and, having established a government
based upon the consent of the governed, they
demonstrated the possibility of a civilised state
without a king or a bishop.</p>

<p>Here the orator grew eloquent, &ldquo;as if to the
manner born,&rdquo; and I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;America&mdash;North America&mdash;is the noblest
country ever given by God to his children&mdash;a
country saved through all the progressive ages
of the world for a new experiment in human
government, and here some British adventurers
opened a branch office. That they might &lsquo;worship
God according to the dictates of their own
conscience,&rsquo; they hurled themselves in their frail
barques, turned their prows&mdash;the ships&rsquo; prows&mdash;to
three thousand miles of boisterous waves,
and landed on Plymouth&rsquo;s rock-bound shores.
Here, defying titanic difficulties, they scaled the
mountains, levelled the forests, tamed the soil,
and, from the jaws of many defeats, they
snatched a glorious victory. Here, they
erected new altars, blazed out a new destiny,
and, rocked in the cradle of Liberty by the
untrammelled winds of heaven, they built a
temple at whose shrines the unborn generations
could freely worship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, the notes record that a young man
in the audience smiled, while poetess Vauline
seemed good-naturedly surprised; noticing
which, Amoora Oseba faltered, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my children, those remarks would be
very tame in America, and a man who could
not soar higher on a &lsquo;fitting occasion&rsquo; would
certainly not be returned at the head of the
poll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in material prosperity, the orator said
that during the first century of America&rsquo;s
national life, she achieved not only unparalleled,
but unapproached success, and during the last
half of that period she accumulated more wealth
than was ever possessed by any other nation.
With nearly half of the railways of the globe,
she furnished half the food and raiment products,
and manufactured more goods than any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a><br /><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>other four nations&mdash;aside from Britain&mdash;and by
the brightest inventive genius the world ever
knew, she had furnished more of the cunning
devices that ease the care and toil of man, than
all the world besides.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">

<p class="center"><i>Queenstown, The Remarkables in the distance.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In moral progress, she has been equally
successful, for she had about two-fifths of all
the newspapers of the world; 72,000 post
offices, 180,000 churches, 450,000 school
teachers, and more libraries and more readers
than any other country; while more than half of
the institutions of higher learning on the globe
were hers, and counting only the real Americans,
more enterprising, ingenious, intelligent and
educated people, than any other nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;America was
Britain&rsquo;s greatest contribution to the world&rsquo;s
progress. These two kindred countries flourished
through reciprocal interests; by their
industrial methods they have lifted the world
from medieval barbarism, and they are destined
to give their language, their civilisation and
their notions of liberty to the whole human race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the poetess Vauline inquired why
America, with all her great wealth and opportunities,
would not be a desirable country to which
to send a colony of the Shadowas?</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&ldquo;A cloud was on his brow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Oseba answered, &ldquo;I love that great and
wonderful country so deeply, and I so much
admire its splendid audacity, that I would
gladly speak kindly, even of its faults; but,
my children, it is not all &lsquo;rosewater and
glycerine&rsquo; in Yankeedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In wealth, in enterprise, in education, in
intelligence, and in opportunities for further
progress, America may justly claim to be the
foremost nation on the globe, and she has
&lsquo;rights&rsquo; no other would care to dispute. But,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&lsquo;The people, Oh! the people,<br />
Those much lower than the steeple.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It is they, of whom we may profitably inquire.
A nation may be rich, though the people may
be poor; a nation may be strong, while the
people are weak; a nation may be feared
because the people can be relied upon to obey
designing masters, but the true greatness of a
nation must ever depend upon the quality of
the individuals composing the nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In America, my children, they sing many
choruses. Listening across the sea, the groans
of despair are heard, mingled with the inspiring
chants of robed priests, and, the public heart being
touched with pity, the bandmaster mounts his
pedestal, looks serenely benevolent, and, raising
his baton with gracefully curving signals, the
populace join in one voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&lsquo;Come, ye, from lands oppressed,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come, join in joyous song,&mdash;</span><br />

Come, &lsquo;walk into our trap&rsquo;&mdash;why need you long delay?&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;These dulcet tones were always supposed
to help fill the immigrant ships, the vacancies
caused by the strike, and the land-boomer&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
pockets, but just as the last faint echoes die
away, there arises from the narrow lane &lsquo;hard
by&rsquo;&mdash;just off Broadway&mdash;the plaintive wail:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&lsquo;Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And <i>that</i> cannot stop their tears.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The young birds are chirping in the nest,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They are weeping bitterly!</span><br />
They are weeping in the playtime of the others,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the country of the free.&rsquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my children, these borrowed
lamentations may come from the fellows who
were left out in the cold at the last elections,
for one &lsquo;can&rsquo;t most always sometimes tell,&rsquo; in
America, whence come the inspiring motives of
the entertainment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you a little story, my children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One November afternoon, while on a west-bound
train, I had as a travelling companion
a very intelligent, patriotic, and sorrowful man.
His manner was subdued, his voice was plaintive,
and he spoke earnestly of the condition of
his country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Skipping his most emphatic words, and
toning down portions of his most lurid sentences,
I will recite to you the substance of
his fervid oration as we hurried over the plains
to overtake the rapidly sinking sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the greatness of America,
my friend said, &lsquo;Some qualifying words may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
necessary, or the ideas sought to be conveyed
may be confusing. We Americans,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;boast of &ldquo;equality before the law,&rdquo; yet in no
other civilised country has favoritism been
carried to more deplorable extremes. We boast
of freedom, yet in no country does a smaller
number of men control the conditions under
which all must live, and we boast of our constitutionally
guarded rights, yet the accidental
head of a party may exercise a power unthinkable
by any constitutional monarch of Europe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But with so intelligent a people, may not
these abuses be remedied?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Intelligent?&rsquo; said he, with a sigh. &lsquo;The
people in America are frequently informed that
they are very intelligent and free, but would a
very intelligent people shovel coal so furiously
into the furnace of a locomotive that was rapidly
running their train to the devil?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In theory, the Americans have erected the
most symmetrical political temple, at whose
altars the devout head of patriotism ever bowed a
humble allegiance; but in practice,&rsquo; said he with
emotion, &lsquo;well, the upper rooms are occupied
by schemers and the halls are crowded by a
more rapacious set of money-changers than the
Master whipped from the temple of Jerusalem.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dollars, dollars,&rsquo; said he bitterly, &lsquo;there is
nothing in America more potent than a million
dollars.&rsquo; Then after a moment&rsquo;s silence he
muttered, &lsquo;yes, five millions are more potent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;However, it would be mockingly absurd,&rsquo;
he sorrowfully continued, &lsquo;for any American to
hoist a danger signal, for the pleasures of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
occasion must not be marred; but,&rsquo; said he,
with a gleam of satisfaction, &lsquo;while Belshazzar
is playing high jinks at the feast, Daniel is
changing his slippers, making ready for a call.
As a fact,&rsquo; said my companion, &lsquo;America is
being looted by her caretakers, and, while the
Philistines are packing away the booty, the
silly Samsons are sleeping in the lap of
Delilah.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend was eloquent and impressive&mdash;his
language was lurid and expressive, his
manner was quite American, and I sympathised
with him, for &rsquo;tis sad to behold the
patriot, sitting with bowed head and solemn
visage, contemplating the waning glory of his
own proud country, and he seemed very
earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;we pulled up at a
pretty city where there was confusion, and my
friend disenrailed. As he stepped off, he met
some friends. They, too, looked unhappy, and,
feeling inquisitive, I alighted, and observing a
pleasant looking fellow on the platform I
approached him, and waving toward my late
companion&rsquo;s party, I interrogatively said:
&lsquo;Funeral?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man actually laughed, and observing
my seriousness, and that I was not of his
country, he laughed again, and glancing at my
friend&rsquo;s group, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Funeral, stranger! We&rsquo;ve had an election,
and it was the d&mdash;&mdash;st landslide ever seen in
these parts, and he&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;is out in the
cold.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Oseba, the notes say, remarked that the bell
rang, he &ldquo;waved&rdquo; to his companion, re-entered
his train, dropped into his seat and&mdash;thought.</p>


<h3>A DIGRESSION.</h3>

<p>The notes indicate that Mr. Oseba was
deeply affected by the revelations of his
&ldquo;travelling companion.&rdquo; He need not despair.</p>

<p>This race has been rather prominently
before the footlights for some time, and
it is of such a mixed and sturdy stock that
it seems endowed with the spirit, if not
of &ldquo;perpetual,&rdquo; at least, of long-continued
youth.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon has not yet filled his
mission, and surely America should not, so
early in its unparalleled career, betray evidence
of decadence. While &ldquo;grow quick, decay
quick,&rdquo; seems to be a law of nations, as well
as of Nature, while wealth is often an evidence
of injustice, and while in numbers there are
often germs of weakness, with America still in
her vigorous youth, there must be virtue in her
strength sufficient to meet these very apparent
difficulties.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, too, that America,
though she had great opportunities, had a
stupendous task before her at her birth as a
nation. In vindication of an inherited British
instinct, the &ldquo;British colonies&rdquo; revolted against
a king, too Dutch to appreciate a British
sentiment, and a parliament, too weak to resist
him, and the &ldquo;British American&rdquo; colonies
became the &ldquo;American nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>But the responsibilities of the new nation
were as tremendous as her opportunities were
fabulous. Politically, she was adrift without
pilot or compass, and she set about to erect
a temple on whose altars her people might
worship, and, without law or precedent, she
built, better than she knew, a theory of government
the astonishment, the pride, and the
admiration of a hopeful world.</p>

<p>Well might the heads of the people have
been a little turned, but lured by the most
tempting opportunities ever offered to man,
they hurled an awakened energy against the
doors of the treasure house of Nature, and soon
marched among the leaders of industrial art&mdash;yes,
away in the vanguard. In defence of her
commerce, her little navy was the first to
humble the Barbary pirates that for centuries
had levied blackmail upon the whole Mediterranean
trade. Her flag was soon seen in every
port, and from the profits of trade in her
products, Britain laid the foundation of a
stupendous industrial system, that made her
the commercial mistress of the world.</p>

<p>Her pursuits were industrial, her ways were
ways of peace. Soon she carried one-third of
the ocean tonnage, and the struggles of the whole
human race were being eased by her inventions.</p>

<p>During these formative stages of development,
real poverty was unknown, and great
fortunes&mdash;such as are being heaped up to-day&mdash;had
never been dreamed of.</p>

<p>But what a period, and what a country for
the development of character! In those peaceful
but industrious and frugal days arose that
splendid school of writers, poets, essayists,
philosophers, publicists and reformers of New
England, and the orators, statesmen, and
patriots of the young days of the Republic.
With such achievements, Mr. Oseba, liberty
cannot perish from the earth. The grotesque
anomalies in America are incidents of the
changing times and will soon disappear.</p>

<p>But to the notes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Room for a colony? Quantity, my children,
but no tempting quality for us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;earnestly I love
America and her splendid people, but the
flag of social progress has been transferred to
other lands, so America must hold the &rsquo;phone,
while others of that splendid race&mdash;more strays
from the Classic Isles&mdash;answer the calls of
Justice and lead Humanity to a broader, higher
and nobler liberty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will ring off America, for while
every phase of the recital is so charming that
one is inclined to loiter, we catch a glimpse
of coming scenes that hurry our hopes for a
pleasing goal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From great and grand America, I took a
long ocean voyage, my children, and on the
&lsquo;other side&rsquo; I found the beginning of the end
of my task, for here, all the dreams of all my
weary wanderings, and all the hopes of all my
fancied visions of better things, found realisation,
and with a glad heart I turned my
thoughts to the friends of Cavitorus.&rdquo;</p>

Bergin notes a short intermission, for,
as there is everywhere a limit to human
endurance, Oseba had grown weary.</p>

<p>During the recess, the notes inform us,
there were many whisperings, many doubtful
shakes of the head, and many real fears expressed
as to results regarding the conclusions
of the report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have gone over the globe,&rdquo; said a
learned-looking matron, &ldquo;and we have no
encouragement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better know the truth,&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of no small importance to

<p>The people stood, or sat, in groups and conversed
earnestly, some consulting a small globe
which stood on the edge of the rostrum. At
the expiration of an hour, the people resumed
their seats, Amoora Oseba took the platform,
and the audience was all attention.</p>

<p>When he arose, he told the people that he
understood their feelings, their hopes, their
fears, and their anxieties. He had done his
best, and his devoted comrades had been as
solicitous as he for their beloved country and
its cause. To err is human, but it were better
to be over-cautious than over-anxious for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
change. Not all changes mean progress, though
this is not always understood, even by the world
leaders.</p>

<p>He told his audience they were not finished&mdash;Oliffa
had not yet been wholly reported upon,
for they had made other discoveries. There
were yet two countries to inspect, and he bid
them be of good cheer. He said the countries
to which he was now to call attention were quite
&ldquo;new&rdquo; in the sense that they had been known,
even to the Outeroos themselves, but a comparatively
short time. He then turned on the
light, exposed the full globe, and proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The earth has practically been circumnavigated,
and, when you have seen all, I
hope you will be satisfied with my efforts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have visited all countries inhabited
by man, and my discoveries have revealed many
interesting facts, suggesting many conclusions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mankind,&rdquo; argued Mr. Oseba, &ldquo;is akin.
All sorts and conditions of men emerged from a
common ancestry. The vast differences in form,
color, language, custom and mentality have
been caused by the varied environing conditions
slowly working throughout many ages. From
common passions, common wants and common
efforts for their gratification, has man slowly
pressed forward, the pace varying as Nature
invited or forbade the movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But genius has annihilated time and space.
The world is being brought in touch, and the
race that improved the cunning of the hand, and
aroused the inquiry of the brain, is destined to
guide, unify, and dominate the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Anglo-Saxon is a peculiar compound
of many mixed and sturdy tribes, and in the genius
of race, there is the magic potion that is giving
tone, language and inspiration to humanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the modern Briton is the finished
product of Anglo-Saxon aims, and inherited
aspiration. The Briton is a trinity composed
of English, Irish and Scotch, a compound of
the most stubborn vices and most sturdy virtues
ever found in an organised society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Janus was not a Briton; the Briton has but
one face, and it is always looking to the front.
The Briton is sturdy, so he presses forward; he
is weary, and he never runs; he is tenacious,
and he appropriates everything having one loose
end. Having more wants than industry, he
invents that he may be satisfied. He adjusts
himself to new conditions, so he hoists his flag
over his new cabin and annexes all in sight.
Being dull as a linguist, the people of all climes
have to learn his speech, or abstain from the
banquet of the present, and&mdash;the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the British are of a sturdy race. They
were developed in a fine climate. But people
can&rsquo;t live on climate, and these people had
appetites. No <i>thing</i> can come from nothing.
Thoughts and actions are &lsquo;products,&rsquo; but the
finished goods always reveal the character of
the raw material. Strange,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;but
as a man eats, so is he. The Frenchman eats
frog, and he dances; the Italian eats macaroni
and he runs a hand organ; while the Briton
as a regular diet takes beef-steak and lion, so he
wanders about, and&mdash;paints the world red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In less time than it took the old nations
to build a city, the inhabitants of the small
British Isles had pre-empted more than one-fifth
of the surface of the planet, and were
masters of the affections of a fourth of the
human race. But the noblest works accomplished
by this resistless people are now to be
revealed, for the admiration of my countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he turned on the great forty-foot
sphere to an axial angle of twenty-three
degrees, well exposing the Southern Hemisphere.
After noticing the southern orifice&mdash;the back
door of Symmes&rsquo; Hole&mdash;and the difference in
the distribution of land and water near the
respective poles, he turned the globe so as
to give a fair exposure of Australasia.</p>

<p>In Oseba&rsquo;s more cheerful demeanor, his more
ready speech, and his radiant countenance, there
was a gleam of joy, and when once the full
import of this new scene was appreciated, there
was a generous burst of applause&mdash;Leo notes,
&ldquo;almost enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the sage Oseba, &ldquo;is the &lsquo;Austral
climes,&rsquo; the last dry dirt on the surface of Oliffa,
wholly rescued from darkness and devoted to
civilisation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its color indicates its social condition&mdash;it
is civilised and free, for on Oliffa, my children,
&lsquo;red&rsquo; is the emblem of hope. &lsquo;Painting the
world red,&rsquo; means turning on the light, and John
Bull always carries a bucket of carmine&mdash;and
he often has a &lsquo;brush.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oseba said that in the whole inquiry he
had endeavoured to follow an example set,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
many centuries ago, by a Personage whose
advice is constantly quoted on Oliffa&mdash;and
more constantly ignored&mdash;of keeping the best
to the last.</p>

<p>Australia was of old called an island, but as
in area it about equalled the United States of
America, and almost that of Europe&mdash;having
near 3,000,000 square miles&mdash;it was now
regarded as a &ldquo;continent,&rdquo; though it had less
than 4,000,000 people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Room for a colony?&rdquo; said the poetess
Vauline, with something bordering emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oseba.</p>

<p>But let us proceed cautiously. I boil down.</p>

<p>He said there was plenty of &ldquo;room,&rdquo; and
for sometime there would be &ldquo;room to let,&rdquo; but
as a fact, while a lovely land, inhabited by a
splendid people, it was not quite all it seemed
on the map. On the borders of the &ldquo;Australian
continent,&rdquo; and reaching back long hundreds
of miles, there was much beautiful
country, but there was a vast interior, which,
though red on the map, was almost too thin
even to hold the paint.</p>

<p>As a fact, much of the surface of Australia
was afflicted, like many of her people,
with an insatiable thirst. To the uninformed,
this &ldquo;dry&rdquo; and hot interior gave Australia a
&ldquo;bad name,&rdquo; as people are usually influenced
by &ldquo;sound,&rdquo; and they rarely stop to reflect how
many grand empires might be carved out from
these fertile borders and plains.</p>

<p>He described how Cook &ldquo;found&rdquo; Australia
in 1770, and how, by the directions of Sydney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Colonial Secretary, it was first &ldquo;colonised&rdquo; in
1779. He recorded its struggles and growth
during the silent years; how colonial authority
was exercised; how self rule, or so-called
&ldquo;responsible government&rdquo; was established; and
how, to reach more remote portions of the
country from convenient seats of authority,
several autonomous colonies were formed.</p>

<p>Owing to the large expense of coming, immigrants
were usually of the better class; and,
owing to the distance from central authority,
the colonist became self-reliant, and soon began
to apply new ideas to new conditions.</p>

<p>He dwelt with evident pleasure upon the
development of the cities of the continental
colonies as splendid centres of wealth and
population, and praised the spirit that was
ready to cast tradition to the winds, and boldly
experiment upon various expedients, that seemed
a solution for some pressing problem.</p>

<p>In describing Australasian cities, he declared
that Sydney was the most beautiful city on
earth, having a society which, for culture and
character, equalled that of any other country.
He admired the competitive spirit as between
the different or several political centres, and of
the many departures from old notions.</p>

<p>The courage of the people in the adoption
of new political methods, and their re-arrangement
of the relations between governments and
industrial forces, seemed to please him greatly.</p>

<p>He declared that &ldquo;these self-governing
autonomous colonies, aroused by inviting opportunities
of a novel environment, inspired by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
sphere of undefined liberty, with reckless readiness
to resort to new expedients for the
accomplishment of new purposes, had produced
in Australasia, in all the essentials of true
worth, the highest average type of man and
womanhood on the surface of Oliffa&mdash;with the
more isolated New Zealand probably leading.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oseba said the Australasians enjoyed a
higher average plane of living than any other
people; they were better educated, better
clothed, better fed, and better housed, and, with
comparisons made on the same or like basis,
they were the greatest commercial people on
the globe, with proportionately much greater
banking power than any other people. In proportion
to population, these 4,500,000 Australasians
had four times the capital of the people
of other leading countries, and their commerce
was four times larger.</p>

<p>He applauded the tendency towards holding
the lands at nominal or low rents for the use
of the people; the construction, ownership and
management of the railways, telegraphs, telephones
and other public utilities, by the
government for the convenience and use of
the governed, as the acme of political wisdom.</p>

<p>He claimed that the Australasians had confirmed
every lesson of history, for all experience
taught that only through colonial enterprise were
experiments in legislation safe, and advanced
ideas crystallised into law. Small communities
might safely experiment, and when the people
bore sway, the dangers possible from rapid changes
were preferable to the mildew of stagnation.</p>

<p>In political and social progress, in material
prosperity and moral worth, the people of
Australasia were conspicuously at the head of
the procession.</p>

<p>Only through the influence of colonial
enterprise, had real liberty ever gained a substantial
victory, and only through expedients
suggested by colonial necessities, had great
economic changes hurriedly come.</p>

<p>America, in her free and fearless youth, far
excelled the motherland in liberal legislation
and economic progress, but the millstone of
aggregated wealth and &ldquo;vested interests&rdquo;
weighed her down, and she retired from the
leadership, while Australasia, with her novel
surroundings and the experience of all the
former ages to contemplate, proposed to sail
a little further over the inviting seas of social
progress, and her success had vindicated the
wisdom of her determination. At a time
when many other nations were almost madly
pushing colonial experiments, she had written
a new volume corroborating the evidence of the
centuries, that Britain alone, of all modern
nations, possessed the requisite qualities for
successful colonisation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Australasia deserves well of the world,&rdquo;
said Oseba, &ldquo;for under the separate standards
of her many colonial chiefs, she has moved the
people on to a most advanced position.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Looking down the Mueller Glacier from Ball Pass, Mount Cook.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But in Australia proper there has recently
come a change that must necessarily check
the rapidity of Australian progress. Six of
the Australasian colonies&mdash;New Zealand not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>joining&mdash;have left the skirmish-line, and formed
into a less mobile mass. The light infantry
have buckled on heavy knapsacks&mdash;the flying
artillery have been re-cast into siege guns.
The &lsquo;states&rsquo; are now anchored to the
past, and the &lsquo;Commonwealth&rsquo; must be
unwieldy. The members of this compact may
chafe, but the chains are unyielding, and the
ponderous hulk, in which all the luggage has
been tossed, will be found cumbrously slow
in its movements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As social groups, the Australians, in their
&lsquo;free colonies,&rsquo; were in their vigorous youth&mdash;they
were buoyant and ambitious. They looked
abroad, beheld what others had done, and said,
&lsquo;Let us take another step,&rsquo; and being free and
self-ruling, they were able to hurriedly adjust
their political machine to their local requirements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inspired by novel environments, great opportunities
and hard necessities, the Ph&oelig;nicians
and the Greeks, as colonisers, gave to Europe
its commercial instincts; and, inspired by like
opportunities and necessities, the British have
not only made the dreams of the ancients a
reality but they have created and firmly
established modern civilisation. America is
the Carthage of Ph&oelig;nicia. Australasia is the
<i>Magna Grecia</i> of Greece. Australia has played
well her part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a new king has come, my children,
&lsquo;who knew not Joseph,&rsquo; and no Moses can lead
the people rapidly out from the shadow of the
&lsquo;Commonwealth.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Australia has a genial climate; she has
broad, fertile acres enough to support a grand
empire; she has a magnificent people, and she
has advanced the standard of social progress
many a league, but a &lsquo;tribal&rsquo; exuberance has
been hampered by allegiance to a central
authority, so the leadership in social progress
must be passed to less incumbered hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world stands in mute admiration at
Australia&rsquo;s social achievements; but, to gratify
the ambition of a few men who desired a
broader field for the display of a splendid
talent, she has lost her &lsquo;innings,&rsquo; and &lsquo;New
Zealand&rsquo; has the bat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Commonwealth band struck up,
it was whispered across 1,200 miles of sea to
New Zealand, &lsquo;Will you walk into my parlor?&rsquo;
but the sturdy Seddon answered, &lsquo;No, thanks!
we will go ahead, and turn on a little more
light.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, while I love the Australians and
shall ever hope for their future prosperity, we
will &lsquo;ring off,&rsquo; and review the last, the loveliest,
and the most free and inviting field ever explored
by man, for already the colors are in
worthy hands, and the leaders have proposed
to take another step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Summing up for a conclusion, the sage
Oseba said that China, even with &ldquo;opportunities,&rdquo;
presented no varieties; and while
Japan had variety, she had no room. Europe
was too strongly wedded to militarism for healthy
mental growth; Britain has become a park
for her nobles; Africa had the black plague;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
America was owned by the trusts, and was
managed in their interests by the party bosses;
and Australia, like a child crying for bracelets,
had put on hand-cuffs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, none of these answer the requirements
of our commission,&rdquo; said the orator, &ldquo;and I
now invite you, my children, to another series
of pictures in our elaborate gallery&mdash;&rsquo;tis of my
last &lsquo;discovery.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, pending the re-adjustment of the
instruments, the audience indulged in a few
moments of lively conversation, for the promises
seemed to be more encouraging. But soon Mr.
Oseba stepped to the front with a confident
dignity, and in a pleasing voice said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My learned colleagues, and you, my
beloved countrymen and women, I have
detained you long, and, that you might appreciate
my conclusions, I have gone somewhat
into details in my extensive review. I have
shown you many of my discoveries, on the outer
surface of our planet; I have explained the
political systems of many peoples, and I have
observed the play of your emotions as the conditions
of men were portrayed; but I now
promise you only pleasing revelations, for in
beauty, in climate, in soil and social situation,
I am going to show you the paradise of Oliffa,
and this means a portion of Australasia that
declined to join the federation of which I have
spoken&mdash;it means New Zealand, on the map,
&lsquo;Zealandia,&rsquo; with the poets, but Zelania, as it
would be called in our more musical speech, and
by this euphonious title shall we speak of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
charming land. This, my children, was my
last discovery, and while many people on Oliffa
don&rsquo;t care to be discovered at all, I hope the
&lsquo;Zelanians&rsquo; will never regret my having landed
on their blissful shores.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has been previously mentioned that Leo
Bergin had &ldquo;done newspaper work in New
Zealand,&rdquo; and here seems a proper place to
re-refer to this pleasing fact.</p>

<p>Leo notes that, pending a re-arrangement of
the stage, there was a brief intermission, and
later, that having become weary from strained
attention, and drowsy from the soothing
pleasures of the occasion, his thoughts flitted
back over the silent years, and falling into a
half-unconscious reverie, he seized the thread
and wove from the thrilling scenes of the past
the panorama of a pleasing dream. In his
chant, we catch the echoes of a farewell to his
native land, and, floating away into aimless
realms, he follows the devious path of other
days, where vaguely arise the fleeting phantoms
of pleasures forever gone.</p>

<p>We know not the mystery of a dream, but
in Leo Bergin&rsquo;s brain the hoary mountains
rise, the restless seas moan, and the scenes of
ever-enchanting Zelania unroll like a magic
scroll. In modest phrase he sings the memories
of early wanderings, and that through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
mental gleams we may reach a higher appreciation
of the unfolding views, I quote his
rippling rhymes:&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, indeed that is pretty; but let us down
from Leo&rsquo;s fancies to Mr. Oseba&rsquo;s facts, and
while I shall strive to retain a seasoning of Mr.
Oseba&rsquo;s richness, time and the love of ease
whisper persuasively of the virtues of the blue
pencil.</p>

<p>With more animated eloquence, Mr. Oseba
resumed his oration. &ldquo;The audience,&rdquo; says
Leo Bergin, &ldquo;gave the most profound attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowledge,&rdquo; said Mr. Oseba, &ldquo;is a priceless
treasure, but,&rdquo; with a smile he continued,
&ldquo;many a good story has been spoiled by over-inquisitiveness.
Poetic fancy suffers from flirtations
with cause and conscience. Unless inquiry
has been thorough, my children, it is wiser, in
most cases, to note impressions than to assume
to record facts, so I shall give you but a &lsquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
view of these enchanting isles, with the
characters as they appeared before the visual
camera when I made my observations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had I gone fossicking among the weary
ones of Zelania, I should doubtless have found
many excellent people who, in some phase of
the inquiry, would have questioned the correctness
of my conclusions. I might have heard
some sighs, amid the almost universal joy&mdash;some
smiles with the general congratulations,
and some discordant groans mingled with the
generous applause&mdash;but where there is not
sufficient diversity of interest to produce mental
friction, there is more danger from decomposition
than from revolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I incline to think had I stood on the
corner and listened I would have met some
well-to-do gentlemen who disliked the land tax;
some business men who disliked the labor laws;
some farmers, who wanted a free ride and no
rent; some patriotic men who failed to admire
many of &lsquo;Richard&rsquo;s&rsquo; taking ways. I might
also have found healthy gentlemen from &lsquo;Home&rsquo;
who, though their conditions were bettered by
coming, have little love for &lsquo;the colonials,&rsquo;
and who, by virtue of their unwillingness to
grasp the true situation, regard every statement
of a fact as an extravagance, and every forward
movement as a revolution. Then, I should
have felt it necessary to inquire how much of
such criticism was due to private interest, to
defeated ambition, to party or factional prejudice,
or to differences in opinion as to who would
best grace the conspicuous chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For this I had neither time nor inclination.
Man can equivocate, can even lie, &rsquo;tis said, but
visible conditions never deceive an observing
stranger, and when I considered the brief
history of that country and compared its early
social and political policy with the present free,
happy and prosperous situation, I had little care to
banquet with private grievance or public criticism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was concerned, not in the salaries of the
public servants, but in the character of the
public conscience; not in who, for the time
being, guided the ship of state, but how the
passengers and the crew were being brought to
their destination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On a lonely elevation, far removed from
the murmuring crowd, I levelled my glass,
and, without sampling the fluids from which
the stage actors drew their inspiration, I noted
my &lsquo;impressions.&rsquo; They were favorable, and if
I&rsquo;m guilty of nothing worse than failing to note
the faults of those chosen by themselves as
ringmasters of the performance, I feel that the
Zelanians will not regret my having &lsquo;discovered
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the beauties of Zelania so far transcend
the powers of the painter&rsquo;s brush and the poet&rsquo;s
metaphor, I pay her homage of my admiration,
in modest speech.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IN SILENT WONDER.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;In scenic wonders, these playful Isles
present a peculiar series of thrilling charms,
which seem to satisfy best the yearnings of
those who have visited other lands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In geography, Zelania is beautifully
isolated, as every beach is washed by more
than a thousand miles of sea. Its borders are
so erratic, so indented by bays, harbors, and
inlets, that its shore-lines are over 4,000 miles
in extent, and, in altitude, it reaches from the
sea-shore to the clouds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Configuratively, it is milder than a dream,
and topographically, it presents a most romantic
and pleasing aspect. In scenic beauty, the Isles
of Greece, the Lakes of Ireland, or the &lsquo;Vales
of Cashmere&rsquo; do not surpass it, and in the
awe-inspiring wildness of its mountain grandeur,
it rivals the noblest of Norway or Alaskan scenes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In bold magnificence, the glacial glories of
the Swiss Alps are tame comparisons, and its
geysers, its boiling lakes, its roaring vents from
subterranean fires, its hundreds of spouting
caldrons, its grottos and waterfalls, could not
be surpassed, if all the rest of Oliffa&rsquo;s wonders
were brought together and placed on exhibition&mdash;such
a congerie of curiosities has Nature
thrown in young Zelania&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Nature made Oliffa, my children,
she nourished a sly intent to show her skill
when in the flower of training. With this in
view, as she deftly moulded other lands and
tempered them from her laboratory, she tossed
aside the choice bits of material, and took notes
on &lsquo;effect.&rsquo; Then, after finishing the rest, and
&lsquo;behold it was very good,&rsquo; with a glance to the
gallery gods, she said, &lsquo;Now look at me!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Waimangu Geyser.&mdash;Semiquiescent.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Then, like the sculptor who has many
models for one figure&mdash;one from which to copy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a><br /><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a><br /><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>the most perfect arm, one the hand, another the
knee, and still another for the foot&mdash;so, she,
selecting from the most perfect of all her former
works, improved on each, and in her happiest
mood she fashioned Zelania, and anchored it in
these southern seas. Then she smiled, and&mdash;took
a <i>siesta</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 282px;">
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="282" height="450" alt="Waimangu Geyser playing" />
<p class="center"><i>Waimangu Geyser playing to a height of 1500ft. The second wonder of
the world.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Geologically,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;Zelania is an
ancient pile of dirt, but here all the games that
frisky Nature played in her boisterous youth,
before &lsquo;Atlantus&rsquo; sank from the Ocean bosom,
before the Mediterranean burst through the
Pillars of Hercules, before the sun and winds
drank the waters from the Sahara, and possibly
before great Chimborazo was, she still keeps on
the stage for the edification or the terror of
gods and men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Rotorua, that trysting place of fairies
and fiends, man may play with Nature as did the
deities of old with the daughters of men; while
at Waimangu, the mightiest geyser on the globe,
one may safely stand within a few yards&rsquo; distance
and behold a scene of thrilling awe that banishes
all consciousness&mdash;save that of dread and power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To stand near the verge and behold this
acre of dark world as it is hurled a thousand
feet into the air, is worth a trip round this little
globe. Language gives but a faint gleam of
human passion, and every effort to describe this
scene brings but a pathetic consciousness of
human frailty. Beholding this mighty convulsion,
even the thoughtless stand motionless
and mute, and as Milton is dead, Waimangu
will never be described in words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The countless mountain lakes, the wild
fiords&mdash;from whose deep recesses one but
rarely sees the sun&mdash;the shady solitudes, so
painfully still that one shudders with a chilling
sense of loneliness, and the easily-approached
glaciers and waterfalls&mdash;many with a plunge of
over a thousand feet, that amaze the Alpine
traveller&mdash;thrill and fill the beholder with
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for one who enjoys the gun and the
rod, there are such tempting opportunities for the
diversion of the attention, that the imagination
finds ready relaxation, and thus the body and
mind gain vigor as the scenes and the days
pass by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Zelania&rsquo;s wonders may be visited
with ease, comfort, and perfect safety. Her
furies are on their good behaviour, and save
on the borders of her terrors, her aspects are
as serene as heaven&rsquo;s azure sky. Her mountains
are rarely disturbed by the ravings of
Pluto, her great geysers are forcible, but not
dangerously erratic, and her boiling springs are
so amiable that they may be studied and safely
observed at short range.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Nature rather recklessly managed this

evident, but save the activity of the geysers and
boiling lakes&mdash;which play for the amusement
of visitors&mdash;and the occasional listing
when some great personage steps too close to
the edge, <i>terra</i> has been satisfactorily <i>firma</i> ever
since the present managers were commissioned
in the early &rsquo;90&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In every natural feature, this is a country
of boundless variety. In climate, it varies from
Finland to Italy; and in production, by intelligent
transplanting, most of the necessities of
civilised life are here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the notes say the poetess Vauline inquired
whether Mr. Oseba had not minutely described
some of these marvellous scenes in his report.
With reverential mien, the sage replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my children, to attempt this, were to
profane the gift and the giver of speech. Only
one who beholds these wonders can appreciate
them. When confronted, the grandeur of the
infinite may be felt by a sensitive soul, but
through an interpreter all attempts fail. Beholding
one scene, I uncovered and bowed my
head in silence.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Words! they were meaningless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, and I will help Mr. Oseba out, for I
have observed these things, and I have read
somewhere how some sort &ldquo;rush in&rdquo; where
even the angels incline to hesitate.</p>

<h3>A DIGRESSION.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my children,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;permit
me to make a few observations based upon my
study among the Outeroos, which will apply to
the country under review.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, all terms expressing quality&mdash;such
as good and evil, right and wrong,
truth and error&mdash;are relative, and, as affecting
men, the definition to each individual depends
upon his environment. As a fact, the rules
expressing these ideas are largely fictions established
by society for its own purpose, but, in
their general application, they must be allowed
considerable latitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A country is good or bad, as it offers or
withholds opportunity for earning a livelihood,
and for the development of the mental faculties
by the application of reasonable efforts; and a
government is good or bad, as it withholds or
encourages such opportunities and aspirations.
&lsquo;When the wise rule, the people rejoice&rsquo;&mdash;even
in the barren districts. It is a matter&mdash;well,
it is a matter&mdash;largely of &lsquo;grey matter.&rsquo;
As a rule, Nature has not been niggard in the
distribution of her blessings. And, as a rule,
the term good or bad, when applied to a
country, applies less to the soil than to the
society. It is college <i>versus</i> cannon, or inquiry
<i>versus</i> credulity. Under a reign of benign
justice, from a barren soil may arise an earthly
paradise, while bigotry, war, and oppression will
make a hell of the fairest valley.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&lsquo;The gods wondered, and Viehnu said to Bel,<br />
&ldquo;With seven wise men shalt thou enter hell,<br />
Or with five fools, pass into paradise.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Give me,&rdquo; said Bel, &ldquo;hell with the wise,<br />
For that is heaven, where they do dwell,<br />
While fools would make of Heaven itself a hell.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The subject, my children, always bears the
image of the law, the expression of custom, and
customs are established by cunning for the rule
of credulity. By custom, one is born the owner
of many broad acres; and by custom, ten
thousand toil without enjoying, that one may
enjoy without toil. But Nature usually lends
herself freely to man&rsquo;s designs. In a vast
monotonous country, despotism is a usual
system of government, Nature suggesting no
change; the leader becomes the chief, the chief
becomes the monarch, the monarch becomes a
despot, and the despot a god.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, in a smaller country with
diversified aspects, indented shore-lines and
water-front, scaleable mountains and erratic
climate, Nature suggests&mdash;change. A holy
discontent appears, the despot becomes a
constitutional monarch, a parliament serves
the people, a cabinet advises the king; and
then, as mountains suggest liberty and seas
adventure, distant colonies, in which custom
and precedent are ignored, are established
on lines in harmony with environing conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Human liberty, my children, rarely gains
a victory in an old, wealthy, populous and well-established
country or government. Society,
under such conditions, becomes conservative;
the rulers love power, the cunning want no
change, the wealthy are satisfied, and the
people, being adjusted to the changeless conditions,
are &lsquo;loyal&rsquo; and contented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Further, every defeat of despotism, every
entrenchment upon the &lsquo;divine&rsquo; territory, every
victory of human liberty, has been due to the
restless inhabitants of the water-front; and
remember, for all the progressive movements of
all the ages, and for what the centuries call
modern civilisation, the world is indebted to
colonial enterprise, conspicuously led by
Ph&oelig;nicia, Greece, and modern Britain.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>BACK TO ZELANIA.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But let us, my children,&rdquo; Oseba continued,
&ldquo;return to Zelania, Nature&rsquo;s choicest, last, and
most successful effort, and to where these
principles apply. In her geographical situation,
her configuration, her soil and climate, she
offers man everything to toughen the fibre, to
quicken the perception, and to strengthen the
imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has the climate, the fertility, the production,
the picturesqueness of Greece, and all
in greater variety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oseba here led his audience into a most
interesting inquiry regarding climatic influence
in the development of a people. He said man
was a part of, and strongly allied to, Nature,
and that he could not escape the influence of
his environment.</p>

<p>In interior tropical regions Nature puts a
black skin and black hair on her people, and,
as a joke, she usually flattens the nose. In vast
interior and warm regions, the complexion are
tawny, with black or tawny hair and oblique
eyes, that shunt the direct rays of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, too,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;island or sea-shore
people are lighter in color than those of the interior,
and not only is the complexion of man,
but his physical proportions, stature and temperament,
modified by climatic conditions. In interior
countries men gradually assume a type&mdash;they
are lithe, and rather small of stature, and so
alike that they seem cast in the same mould;
while those living on islands along the water-front,
or among the mountains, are more
sturdy, they vary more in build, size and deftness,
and they are mentally more inquisitive,
venturesome, impetuous and brave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said that by far the most sturdy, virile,
impulsive and enterprising people on Oliffa inhabited
the British Isles. Of course, the race
had much to do with modern movements, but
the earlier climatic conditions of the country
produced the racial distinctions.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 285px;">

<div class="hanging">
<p class="hanging"><i>The Moa of Maoriland. The skeleton of this particular Moa stands about
12ft. high, and is a curious but substantial fact, but as the Moa, the
dinornis&mdash;as the learned folks call it&mdash;permanently retired from New
Zealand, possibly before the Maoris came, the plumage and plumpness
are the works of the artistic naturalist.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;By the rule of Nature, then,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;Zelania, with the proper stock to begin
with, in complexion, form, feature, temperament,
and mental endowments, should produce the
finest type of man and womanhood on the
planet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He compared the Maoris with the aboriginals
of interior Australia, and said both were
modified by their environment.</p>

<p>Here Leo Bergin remarked that Mr. Oseba
was certainly greatly taken and impressed by
his &ldquo;colonial&rdquo; experience. However, it is
not improbable that while travelling in New
Zealand Mr. Oseba received sufficient courtesies
to impress him deeply with the matchless hospitality
of the people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, enough,&rdquo; says Leo Bergin, &ldquo;my
master is worthy of my whole attention,&rdquo; and
the notes run:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a><br /><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me return, my children, and pick
up the theme of Zelania, for in her&mdash;with my
tours over her romantic islands&mdash;I found balm
for all my earlier disappointments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania has certainly not worried her soul
in life-producing efforts. In botany, she is not
rich in species; in mammals she is more allied
to South America, over six thousand miles
distant, than to Australia, but twelve hundred
miles, justifying my conviction that this paragon
of beauty was an after-thought of the creative
power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In mammals she has but a little rat&mdash;a
poor little weakling that has not yet been tamed
or learned to board with the people&mdash;and two
little half-developed bats. Of reptiles, there
are a few lazy lizards, but whether some
&lsquo;Patrick&rsquo; or &lsquo;Denis&rsquo; had banished them, I
could not say; but snakes, there are none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said there were some land birds, but as
there were no animals to &ldquo;make them afraid,&rdquo;
the more indolent of them had lost their wings
and their natural characteristics had changed.</p>

<p>The moa was probably&mdash;some time ago&mdash;a
pretty respectable bird, but there being
no danger from which to &ldquo;flee&rdquo; and no long
flights to procure food, it cast off its wings
and strutted about until its bones became
as heavy as those of a reindeer, and it
stretched up its head until it stood twelve feet
high. But having no cares nor anxieties, no
fears nor ambition, it failed to develop &ldquo;grey
matter,&rdquo; so when the Maori came it &ldquo;surrendered,&rdquo;
and, having taken off its flesh as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
well as its wings, it is now resting in the
museums. Without the rod or the bun, there
seems to be no effort, and without effort there
seems to be little progress with any created
thing.</p>


<h3>THE MAORIS &ldquo;DISCOVERED.&rdquo;</h3>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent epigraph">&ldquo;And the great god Morduch heaved the earth from
its watery bed, and peopled its shores according to his
will.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>As Oseba evidently meant to proceed upon
his discourse in some predesigned order, he here
gave some interesting attention to the Maoris,
the natives&mdash;or, so-called, aboriginals&mdash;of New
Zealand.</p>

<p>The orator, in his inimitable manner,
described the Maoris with amusing detail.
He calls them a fine race of romantic savages,
whose physique had undoubtedly been greatly
improved by the winning smiles of Zelania&rsquo;s
climate and general aspects; for &rsquo;tis said
they have been loafing around there for 500
years. &ldquo;A large, heavy, dark brown people are
these Maoris, who, in their own picturesque
costume, often looked gracefully noble. Brave
and ferocious while untamed, they are usually
amiable and indolent when subjected to civilising
influences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the young women were very pretty,
and the children were quick in wit and movement.
He did not think that tattooing the under lips
of the women had really improved their beauty.
Many of the half-castes were very intelligent, and
not a few had made excellent reputations, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
politics and other &ldquo;professions.&rdquo; Many of
them, too, had a sublime gift of &ldquo;gab,&rdquo; and this
trait is shared&mdash;even by the men.</p>

<p>Intellectually the Maoris were, Oseba
thought, superior to any other tamed savage;
but, like other barbarians, when touched by
civilisation, they learned and accepted the vices
more readily than the virtues. This was noticeable
in all civilising movements. Oseba remarked
that it was often observed among the Outeroos
when speaking of such people, that the &ldquo;Christian
vices&rdquo; killed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was natural, for while it
takes time to teach the &lsquo;brethren&rsquo; the real advantages
to be derived from the practices of
Christian virtue, the &lsquo;Christian vices&rsquo; yield
&lsquo;immediate returns.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou shalt not steal&rsquo;
to a savage produces a peculiarly disagreeable
confusion of ideas, and the advantages are not
readily apparent, but two drinks of whisky
rarely failed to impress. This is a custom
peculiar to &lsquo;Christian culture&rsquo; that is
&lsquo;taking.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To judge by the conspicuous exhibitions of
artistic effort and the countless displays by the
photo fiend in many of Zelania&rsquo;s towns, a
stranger would conclude that the Maoris were
the &lsquo;superior&rsquo; and dominant race, though
there are but a little over 43,000 in the whole
country, mostly on the north or warmer island,
and it is said they are about stationary in
numbers and in morals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told his audience that these Maoris, when
originally discovered, were a stalwart, brave and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
rather superior race of savages; that war was
the only argument that appealed to their perverted
consciences, and he quoted an admiring
New Zealand poet to prove the &ldquo;amiable&rdquo;
heroism of the Maori &ldquo;ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&ldquo;E&rsquo;en woman, formed for sweetness, for love, and tender art<br />
Here showed the tiger instinct, the hard and ruthless heart;<br />
Her&rsquo;s was the task in battle, the wounded braves to slay,<br />
And cook the reeking corpses for the feast that closed the fray.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Maori women were brave, very
brave, but, my children, in all Zelania there was
not a mouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of these Maoris, there are several tribes,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;who, when free from the meddlesome
&lsquo;white man&rsquo;s yoke,&rsquo; are usually engaged in
slaying and stewing each other, and, besides
carving with their greenstone cleavers their
cooked brethren and their own faces, they
practised much in wood-carving. In this, while
the workmanship is fair, there is a manifest
lack of a sense of proportion, that amuses the
connoisseur as it delighted the amateur in art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the more common, or at least more
numerous and more pretentious white fellow-citizen,
these Maoris go to church some, and to
school, and to the drink-shop and to jail, but as
the Maoris have a little creed of their own, they
don&rsquo;t go to church very much. But if the Maori
goes less to church, to school, and to Parliament,
he also goes less to jail and to the hotel
than his more pretentious white British fellow-citizen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Maoris are picturesque, especially at
the more popular tourist resorts, where their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
presence lends a particularly charming romance
to the occasion. The emotional tourist&mdash;especially
if a young gentleman from &lsquo;Home&rsquo;&mdash;who
is safely piloted by the alert, polite,
and loquacious &lsquo;Maggie&rsquo; among the roaring
and exploding geysers of that charming
compromise between awe-inspiring beauty and
terror, that unpreached sermon, that unsung
song, that unwritten poem, that section of
hell in an earthly paradise, Rotorua, in whose
weird precincts are seen and heard and
smelled, at close range, the seething fires of
&lsquo;Pluto&rsquo;s dread abode,&rsquo; he will cherish a generous
respect for Maori hospitality forever. Under
Maggie&rsquo;s watchful guidance, the most unsophisticated
tourist could safely approach the yawning
mouth of these boiling caldrons without
endangering life or health or appetite; though,
unless one heeds the cautious guide, the boot
soles are in danger of shrinking, and in these sulphurous
regions &lsquo;kuss words&rsquo; flow from pious lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; Oseba argued, &ldquo;was a unity and is
consistent. She ignores individuals, and strives,
oblivious to time, for universals. No created
thing ever escapes the influence of environment.
But Nature carries out her works with
the instruments at hand. Whence came
these Maoris is a guess, but as in character,
stature, proportion, personal bearing, and
mental possibilities, no other savage on the
globe compares with them, they must have
been sufficiently long in Zelania to have become
modified by, and made to conform to, the luring
conditions of that wonderful country.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>But I must continue:&mdash;</p>

<p>As there were no indigenous grains or
tameable animals, and as no people ever
worked out a civilisation without the assistance
of tameable animals, the Maori could only
remain a savage, but the climate and general
aspect of Nature, the peculiar environing conditions,
gave him the noblest soul and most
fertile intellect ever housed in the brain of a
barbarian. The conduct of the Maoris in
defence of their country, considering the relative
conditions of the contending forces, found
no parallel in history or romance.</p>

<p>They had all the cunning and duplicity of
the Greek, the stubborn courage of the ancient
Briton, and the stoical disdain for death of the
North American Indian. While in the whirligig
of the great world&rsquo;s doings a contest between
the most skilful of all warriors and a few small
tribes of savages, in so remote a country, could
excite no very great interest among the far-away
nations, to the watchful student of events there
were few pages of history more interesting than
the Maori wars in Zelania.</p>

<p>Socially, the Maori was of a peculiar mould.
A communist in property, he was an aristocrat
by nature, and in his soul there was a haughty
exuberance of spirit that rendered tribal discipline
difficult, and domestic peace precarious.
In war, the Maori was brave; in diplomacy,
shrewd; in council, a born orator.</p>

<p>The Maori remained a savage in Zelania
because there was nothing to tame him, but in
his nature there was the diamond, and, by a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
grinding, its brilliancy always burst forth. His
native environment had given him everything
of a superior mould but the final touch. I
quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already from the grim huts of these late
savages have come forth the orator, the lawyer,
the statesman, and the successful business man.
&lsquo;From the cannibal feast to the Cabinet,&rsquo; is
almost true of the Maori.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fate of the Maoris?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my children, I don&rsquo;t know, but the
grafting of civilisation on such a stock may
work wonders, and to study these most picturesque
of all the sons of Nature, is worth a
journey around this little world.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="362" height="450" alt="Tattooed Maori chief" />
<p class="center"><i>Tattooed Maori Chief.&mdash;&ldquo;Maori Carving.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;It is most interesting,&rdquo; continued Oseba, &ldquo;to
study the aboriginals of any country, and it is
pathetic to observe their gradual retirement
from the earth&rsquo;s fair face; but the Maori&mdash;the
handsome, haughty, aristocratic and eloquent
Maori&mdash;is as different from all other uncivilised
races as his enchanting island home is different
from all other countries on the surface of Oliffa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If bare-handed Nature in Zelania, with no
animals for the chase, none for herds or for servants
of industry, and practically no grain or
fruit, could spank the savage, common to
other lands into this shape, what may it not do
for civilised man, who brings with him all the
aids of all the ages?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oseba explained that before he called on
Zelania he had visited every other country on
Oliffa, and had studied the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; races carefully,
but the Maoris stood solitary and alone.
All others lacked physical fibre and mental
stamina, and for them to remain in contact with
the superior races meant many generations for
doubtful growth, or a few generations for extinction.</p>

<p>But the Maoris had now attained full manhood.
They were &ldquo;different&rdquo; from the whites,
and this was more proper than to say they were
very much &ldquo;inferior.&rdquo; They had enjoyed none
of the advantages of outside communication,
no aid from tameable animals, no experiences
by the chase, no traditions of industrial art,
during probably more than five hundred years.
Yet the Maori seems to have attained to a surprising
degree a fairly full mental and physical
stature. He has eloquence, perception, inquisitiveness
and acquisitiveness. He has everything
but&mdash;civilisation. He has the soul, but it needs
tuning; the material, but it needs shaking-up
and seasoning. The magic touch of a newer,
a higher inspiration is needed, and that is being
injected into his awakening consciousness by a
benign social sentiment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;the Zelania Maori,
as seen in his grotesque works of art, in his
struggle for wild independence, in his weird
religious ceremony, in his common avocations as
toiler, professional man or politician, is the most
picturesque human being on the planet, and
his presence in Zelania gives a seasoning of
romance to be studied and enjoyed in no other
land.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SCENE_VIII_Act_II" id="SCENE_VIII_Act_II"></a><i>SCENE VIII.&mdash;Act II.</i></h2>

<h3>APPROPRIATING A WORLD.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">All</span> being in readiness, a number of very
perfect maps were thrown on the canvas,
showing the plains, valleys, mountains,
lakes, and rivers of Zelania, with the nature of
the production of each island; and a careful and
detailed description as to location and resources
was given by the orator.</p>

<p>Then, calling the attention of his audience,
Oseba notified the people that he was now
reaching the closing chapter of his report, or in
our refined phrase he was on &ldquo;the home
stretch.&rdquo; He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my children, at this stage of our
inquiry, I desire to remind you again how
closely man is allied to Nature; how he is
adjusted to all the environing conditions; how
the fresh breezes of a temperate zone give him
a fair skin; how a varied and pleasing aspect
gives him a cheerful temperament; how the
mountains suggest to him freedom, and the
seas adventure; how climate depresses or
exhilarates; how pastoral pursuits awaken the
romantic in his nature; agriculture, patience
and sturdy industry; and the search for precious
metals, a careless independence and intelligence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, for this last, let the Titans wrest
from Nature all that conspired to make
the Ph&oelig;nician, the Greek, the Norse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the Briton, and mould them artistically into
the most pleasing form, and lo! Zelania would
appear in her pristine glory to&mdash;fashion a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he briefly described the workings of the
government of Zelania, how it had adopted the
parliamentary system of Britain, and that,
while it acknowledged a proud allegiance to
the British crown, it was probably the most
unmitigated democracy the world had ever
beheld.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a member of a compact,&rdquo; Oseba said,
&ldquo;Zelania owes but a loose allegiance to the
Motherland, for she is at liberty to part the
cable at any time and float away with the
parental blessings. But, as a fact, she is held
by a sentiment stronger than bands of steel;
and by the voluntary sacrifice of many of her
noblest sons on distant fields, she has proven,
not only her loyalty to the Crown, but her love
for the Empire and her devotion to British
aspiration. Theirs is not merely the loyalty
of the subject&mdash;&rsquo;tis the tender regard of children
for the generous kindred of homeland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my children,&rdquo; continued the orator, &ldquo;I
am going to show you another series of views,
some the works of man, and some the works
of Nature, that have influenced my actions.
Glance through the album I have given you,
and you will see the style of men, who, on
the lines so strongly suggested by the inviting
environment, have fashioned the social creeds
of the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a grand thing to behold men strong
enough and brave enough to lead the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
up, not to where they may &lsquo;see the promised
land,&rsquo; but to secure for them and their children
a nobler heritage than Joshua ever saw or
Moses ever dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The orator claimed that though the mightiest
imagination could not reach a comprehension of
these enchanting scenes, he felt that the views
presented would justify his claim that of all
lands Zelania was the most wonderful on the
globe.</p>

<p>And now he proceeded to call attention to
the human side&mdash;how the denizens of this
most favored country were using their peerless
opportunities, and this was even more wonderful,
for Nature followed rules and precedents, while
these people broke them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man may famish,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;surrounded
by the most dazzling splendor; he
may starve, amid the most wild, weird and
stupendous beauty; but when erratic Nature
has strewn in the same garden that which
most elevates the soul and administers most
to the nourishment of the body, man should
tender the tribute of his admiration and gratitude,
and&mdash;&lsquo;go to work.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Zelania, as I interpret the orator&rsquo;s meaning,
the gods have conspired to do all this, and
to make the lot of man a happy one. But in a
life so frail and so full of wants, the practical
side deserves consideration, for while the Deity
may furnish the paddock, he will not throw
blood oranges on fern trees, or grow &ldquo;A No. 1&rdquo;
cauliflower on ground not subdued by the spade
or the plough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>After having made so fine an exhibition of
the choice spots of Zelania, Oseba commented
upon the peculiar notions of the Outeroos
regarding their visits to other lands. He said
by the Outeroos&rsquo; measure, he himself had been
the world&rsquo;s greatest &ldquo;discoverer,&rdquo; for he had
found and charted the whole outer surface. He
had &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; China, Japan, Russia, and
other countries; he had discovered Africa,
America, Australia, and finally the &ldquo;Paradise
of Oliffa&rdquo;&mdash;Zelania.</p>

<p>Many people on Oliffa did not care to be
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, would rather not have
been, and, among these, were not improbably,
those fading Maoris of Zelania. The &ldquo;discoverer&rdquo;
had been the bane of many a people&mdash;remember
the color-line!</p>

<p>Oseba told his people that &ldquo;Zelania was once
discovered by Tasman in 1642, and that it was
not discovered again for more than a hundred
years, when Cook found it in 1769. Later, to
the temporary joy and final regret of the
Maoris, the French also &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; the
country, and soon some gentlemen from Sydney
called, and in 1814 the &lsquo;parsons&rsquo; found it,
since which time the collections have been
regular. I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;am Zelania&rsquo;s last &lsquo;discoverer,&rsquo;
and my report shall be a modest one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1840 the Union Jack was permanently
nailed up in queenly Auckland, Zelania being
made a province of New South Wales, and the
next year the country was erected into a colony,
with a good billet for the favorite of a British
Premier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1865 the capital was removed to Wellington,
a very breezy city, with fine &lsquo;sloping&rsquo;
hills at no great distance from the water-front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As in other British colonies, government
here meant liberty, and, as in all
habitable countries liberty means progress,
Zelania has had a full measure of prosperity,
practically from the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; proceeded Oseba, &ldquo;the Outeroos ever
evolve a generation of thinking men, the mystery
of mysteries to them will be how a people as
educated and business-like as the generation,
who discovered and developed steam and
electricity, and the modern commercial systems
could be stupid enough to give away or sell to
a few of the people the land upon&mdash;and from&mdash;which
all the people must necessarily live.
Further, it will be interesting to inquire by
what course of reasoning the temporary custodians
of the public domain arrived at a conclusion
that they could rightfully alienate it,
ignoring the will and the right of all who might
come by the next train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As broad, as almost limitless, as is the
meaning of supreme authority among the
Outeroos, by no compromise with expediency,
by no stretch of the imagination, can any
human power consign the future generation to
a madhouse, or to homelessness, or to a condition
of serfdom under the heirs of the more
fortunate few; but to grant the lands to a small
number of persons is to pawn the cage in which
the animals are eternally locked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, before the &lsquo;rulers&rsquo; of Zelania
had been broadened by the pure air of this wonderland,
they had parcelled out much of the
better lands to a comparatively few persons.
But the grapes fed by the early rulers to
the parents of the colonials, set the teeth of the
children on edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The area of Zelania is 104,000 square
miles, as against 124,000 for the United
Kingdom; and the population is 800,000, as
against 40,000,000 for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, behold the growing wisdom of the
generations! In the United Kingdom, by
inheritance, by the crimes of authority, a few
hundred families, or less than one out of every
2,000 of the population, &lsquo;own&rsquo; nearly one-half of
the whole country; while in this new world, the
smaller follies of earlier rulers are already being
corrected, and the lands are being rescued from
baronial control and held for &lsquo;the people,&rsquo;
regardless of the time of the arrival of their
train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Outeroos are mostly land animals,
my children, and as we have learned how
important the land is to human happiness, I
will give you briefly this phase of the social
situation of Zelania as being developed by
its present leaders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he reminded his audience that Zelania
embraced 104,000 square miles or about
66,000,000 acres of land.</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba claimed that the British Isles,
with 79,000,000 acres, with a considerable area
of waste, support nearly 40,000,000 people;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Italy with about 70,000,000 acres, with
much waste, supports 30,000,000 people;
Prussia, with about 90,000,000 acres, large
areas of waste, supports 31,000,000 people;
France, with about 125,000,000 acres,
with extensive mountain regions, supports
nearly 40,000,000 people; and that Belgium
and Holland, with about 18,000,000 acres,
and much waste, support over 10,000,000
people.</p>

<p>He argued that if the estimates were approximately
correct, this most favored of all
lands on the surface of Oliffa would support, on
a like plane of living of the Italians, 22,000,000
of people; on a like plane of the French,
12,000,000 people; and on a like plane of the
British Isles, at least 10,000,000 of people.</p>

<p>But he explained that with a like population
of these countries a like plane of
living would be inevitable; so, for the happiness
of Zelania, he thought, it was fortunate that
many splendid obstacles stood in the way of
a rapid increase in population. The cry for
population was the most delusive mockery that
ever lured a people to the verge of misery.</p>

<p>Here I quote the intrepid discoverer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;B-i-g does not spell &lsquo;great.&rsquo; China has what
most of the new countries of Oliffa are screaming
for&mdash;&lsquo;population.&rsquo; Yet China is not considered
&lsquo;great.&rsquo; India, even with British rule, as
a people or a race is not &lsquo;great.&rsquo; The true greatness
of a nation consists in the greatness of the
individual units composing the nation, and not
in their numbers. America is great as a nation,
but the real average &lsquo;greatness&rsquo; of the individual
American has been declining for many
years. Better travel comfortably with a select
party than rush to ruin in a crowded train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no relation between size and
value. Even the most ambitious Outeroo
would hardly claim Lambert, who weighed
forty stone, to have been &lsquo;greater&rsquo; than little
Pope, who looked like an interrogation point
and weighed but eight. So, as there is no
virtue in avoirdupois, there is no &lsquo;greatness&rsquo;
in mere numbers. Better flirt with one healthy
girl, than take a dozen sour old maids to the
pantomime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba might have mentioned, had he
known the facts, that Ph&oelig;nicia, that gave to
the world the ship and the alphabet, and anticipated
modern commercial methods, occupied
but a small strip of country&mdash;mostly sterile&mdash;from
eight to twenty-five miles wide, and less
than a hundred and eighty miles long; that
Attica, at the feet of whose philosophers we
still sit, from whose artists we still copy, and
to whose orators we still listen, embraced but
seven hundred square miles; and that the
population of Sparta, while in her glory,
probably never exceeded ten thousand souls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my children,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;b-i-g,
does not spell &lsquo;great,&rsquo; and any Zelanian who
is caught howling for &lsquo;population&rsquo; should be
compelled to &lsquo;shout&rsquo; for the whole crowd
until he goes &lsquo;broke,&rsquo; and has to hunt a billet
to enable him to buy a beer and a bun. The
desirable cannot be bribed&mdash;others should not
be wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, Leo Bergin, with a deep love for
Zelania, &ldquo;pimples out into poetry&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;on his

</p>

<p>Well, that is as refreshing as it is novel.
Mr. Oseba and Leo are both right, and I say,
&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; for a popular gentleman of old
said: &ldquo;He that provideth not for his own
household has denied the faith, and is worse
than an infidel,&rdquo; and if this was Paul, he was
not far &ldquo;beside&rdquo; himself on this occasion.</p>

<p>It is very pleasing mental recreation to talk
about the &ldquo;brotherhood of man&rdquo; and the equal
rights of &ldquo;all the children of God&rdquo; to play
anywhere on the surface of His &ldquo;footstool,&rdquo; but
Nature suggests that &ldquo;every living creature&rdquo;
shall hold down its claim or it will be crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
out, and this same cruel, relentless, unsympathising
&ldquo;Nature&rdquo;&mdash;that always &ldquo;barracks&rdquo;
for her longest-clawed children&mdash;helps to shovel
the weak into the compost heap.</p>

<p>With the achievements of modern times,
with industrial progress, specialised effort and
rapid transit, the many-hued people of the
earth may enjoy the fruits of all lands without
practising at the same bar or sitting at the
same table.</p>

<p>That &ldquo;God made all men equal&rdquo; is pretty&mdash;it
is very pretty; but it lacks the merit of scientific
truth, and while it may be desirable&mdash;profitable&mdash;to
deal with the outside &ldquo;barbarian,&rdquo;
and to aid, educate, and elevate him,
none but a fool or a fanatic would bring a
hoard of park loafers into his dining-room and
seat them at his table, to the exclusion of his
own children&mdash;or his wife&rsquo;s relations.</p>

<p>We may do justice by a &ldquo;brother&rdquo; man
without boarding him or converting him into
a brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania&rsquo;s needed population will arrive in
due season, for, besides her own resistless
attractions, Oliffa must be more densely covered;
but in &lsquo;filling up the country&rsquo; from abroad, the
heads should be weighed and not counted. Zelania
may select her own coming population, for
whether for health, for profit, for pleasure, for
curiosity, or to study lessons of the highest
social and political wisdom, she is curiosity&rsquo;s
magnetic pole, and with prudent management
on the part of her &lsquo;rulers&rsquo; she will soon become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the happy loitering place for the leisure-loving,
wealthy, and well-to-do of all lands. Then,
thousands of those who &lsquo;call&rsquo; will be so
charmed with her faultless climate, her
romantic scenery, her hospitable people, and
her splendid opportunities for domestic happiness
and private gain, that they will cast their
lots in this ever-enchanting land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nature points to Zelania and says to all
her children:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come and see what I did when I had my
hand in.&rsquo; Then, my children, let me anticipate,
for I desire that you may now
have a glimpse of the goal to which I am
leading you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I may tell you these British people
to whom I have briefly referred, composed
almost exclusively in this case of English,
Irish and Scotch, being far removed from central
authority, so strongly tempted by new
opportunities, and so resistlessly influenced by
new and pressing demands, have amazed the
world by the boldness of their political conceptions
and by their marvellous achievements
in social experiments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Mr. Oseba&rsquo;s oration one would conclude
that never did a colony of loyal people
more readily depart from traditional usages,
never did a community enter into the possession
of a new country who so readily adjusted
themselves by their customs, their laws, and
their rules of action to the requirements of a novel
environment as did the settlers of this peerless
land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>He claimed that, in little more than half a
century, before they were three-quarters of a
million souls, by their achievements in social
evolution the Zelanians had excited the interest
and won the admiration of the civilised
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selfishness,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;is the mainspring of
human action, and the actuating motive of every
human being is to secure the greatest possible
happiness with the least possible expenditure of
physical toil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though the social instincts of man help to
tame him, all social and political systems in
the world are based upon very human traits.
The savage, for his own happiness, by force
appropriates whatever he wants or can get.
The half-civilised man cunningly appropriates
the land, that its fruit may ripen in his
granary, that himself and family may be happy,
while the really civilised man would divide the
opportunities among all, and his happiness is
found in the general joy. The Zelanians are
being civilised by evolution and parliamentary
enactments.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And they allotted the land as each had need.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>Oseba reaffirmed his conclusions that no
people ever took possession of a new country
who shaped the land laws with a due regard
to those who came later&mdash;with rights just as
holy&mdash;save the Zelanians. In this they
were more nearly complying with the
rational demands of justice than any other
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a glimpse of the
policy now in vogue, and how it seems to satisfy
the hopes of its sponsors, for this will deeply
interest you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The orator here began a review of the land
system of Zelania, and, with a view to brevity,
the notes will be &ldquo;boiled down&rdquo; to the lowest
possible comprehensive space.</p>

<p>As the country was originally divided into
some nine provinces with as many governing
bodies, each vested with authority to deal with
and dispose of the public domain, there naturally
arose a system that resulted in great inequality,
as well as in great confusion. Then
as all the provinces were in need of roads,
bridges, schools, and other public improvements,
they vied with each other in offering inducements
for immigration or new population, and
with a hand exceedingly lavish, the lands were
alienated&mdash;often in large tracts.</p>

<p>When the Colonial Parliament took over
the public property&mdash;by an abolition of provincial
authority&mdash;the land question at once
assumed a new importance. This came about
at the most intense stage of the modern transitionary
period. &ldquo;Industrial progress&rdquo; had
ushered in the most resistless spirit of commercial
expansion in all countries. Then
population became a &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; and railway
construction became almost a mania everywhere.</p>

<p>The contagion struck Zelania. Public improvements
were an absolute necessity, and
the lands were the chief assets and &ldquo;capital.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
For a time the lands were recklessly sold,
but the mania for internal improvements became
so unconquerable that foreign capital
was called, and by a resort to the seemingly
most reckless borrowing policy ever indulged
in by a sane people, the lands were partially
saved for a better future.</p>

<p>I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the 66,000,000 acres there are said to
be 35,500,000 &lsquo;occupied,&rsquo; and of this, 16,000,000
acres are &lsquo;freehold,&rsquo; 11,000,000 are held under
various crown leases, while the rest is leased
from private owners, or from the natives&mdash;who
own, as a people, several million acres. As the
Maoris are usually tired, these lands are mostly
leased to the &lsquo;superior race,&rsquo; who do the work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number of holdings is 115,713, with an
improved value of £120,981,599. This is good.
It shows an unparalleled proportion of land-holders,
but it is not enough, and the &lsquo;Government&rsquo;
is making strenuous efforts to increase
proportionately the population of rural districts,
and of &lsquo;land holders,&rsquo; if not of land &lsquo;owners.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under an old system, the lands were so
recklessly disposed of that even yet fully one-fourth
of those &lsquo;occupied&rsquo; are &lsquo;owned&rsquo; by
comparatively few people; but the Government
has applied a strong &lsquo;persuader&rsquo;&mdash;graduated
land tax&mdash;and the great inequality
will gradually disappear. The issue now is,
&lsquo;custom <i>versus</i> justice,&rsquo; and with the face
turned to the new, the old loses its potency.
The burden should be more on the land and
less on the laundry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The laws and rules applied to the land of
Zelania of late years, not only take into consideration
the desires and requirements of
would-be occupiers, but also the class of the
land&mdash;the holdings for the better to be smaller
in area than those for the poorer tracts. Of
good or first-class land, under certain tenures,
640 acres only may be taken or held, and of
second-class, 2,000 acres.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are several tenures under which
&lsquo;crown lands&rsquo; in Zelania may be acquired&mdash;one
by purchase for cash; one with lease and
right to purchase, rent to be 5 per cent. on
unimproved value; and one, an eternal lease
(999 years) with a rent of 4 per cent. during this
period on original capital value&mdash;unimproved.
Compulsory residence of the holder is enjoined
during the currency of the lease in leasehold
tenures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the <i>ægis</i> of the law, if wise and just,
people are encouraged and assisted by the
Government in forming small agricultural communities
of not less than twelve heads of families&mdash;for
the Outeroos have families&mdash;and this
group may have set apart for them a suitable
block of land upon which to settle. This
secures educational advantages, for in every
community the Government not only establishes
schools, but compels parents to send their
children for instruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when conscience was thoroughly
aroused, it became evident to the most casual
observer, that the great estates not only stood in
the way of social progress, but that holding vast
areas out of cultivation was a menace to the
future liberties of the people. And further, that
though there were considerable Crown lands
suitable for occupation, the conditions for
&lsquo;closer settlement&rsquo; on them were not over
favorable; and, further still, that every successful
effort to settle these lands not only vastly
increased the value of the great estates, but
increased the temptation of the large owner to
further extend his domain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the earlier <i>régime</i> the follies of the
old rapidly spread over the new world, and by
1890 most of the better lands in Zelania were
parcelled out in lordly estates and owned by a
few persons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost before the people were aware of the
tendencies of the times, a gigantic land monopoly
threatened to overshadow the country. But
being 14,000 miles from central authority, the
affections of the people for hoary customs had
weakened, and vested rights in ancient wrongs
soon began to find earnest protestation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rights of imminent domain were understood,
the people had no notion of erecting a
landed aristocracy, and a few bold souls, who,
by the force of inherent genius had arisen from
the industrial ranks, conceived the idea of
writing another chapter in the history of human
progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No people,&rdquo; Mr. Oseba argued, &ldquo;ever yet
revolted against a despot who ruled with
smiling diplomacy, but having learned in the
old home the power of the world owners, and
knowing that the liberties of none are secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a><br /><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>where a few are vested with the instruments of
oppression, people in this new and strange
country felt the weight of the lordly hand
possibly before it was ungloved for action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The land barons, with their sheep, inhabited
the fertile valleys, while the people with their
children, roamed over the sterile hills. But
with the squeezing of the people into the bush
there was a rush of brains to the head, and the
chosen guardians of the public weal said:
&lsquo;Zaccheus, come down.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though New Zealand mutton was of good
quality and wool bore a good price, some
healthy gentlemen concluded that men and
women and children were about as good as
sheep, especially when the sheep belonged to
the other fellow, and as the barons had no
blunderbusses and the people had votes, the
world-owners were called down to pay a little
more of the taxes, and the people were called up
to earn a square meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the show was opened&mdash;without a
prayer or a corkscrew&mdash;and some very sensible
men who stood on firm ground suggested that
any man who had muscle and a mouth should
have an opportunity to exercise the one for the
satisfaction of the other, and when the world-owners
declined to &lsquo;set a price,&rsquo; the agents of
this brave democracy came with a persuader,
and the revolution was begun.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The land barons were treated honorably.
The values created by the coming of a
progressive population, by the settlement on
Crown lands, and by the construction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>highways, were generously allowed them; but
when asked to move off the grass and make
room for closer settlement, they learned to
accept the situation, and the laws had a soothing
influence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The graduated land tax is a powerful
persuader, and already there have been
about seventy of the great estates resumed
and divided into small allotments among an
intelligent, industrious and progressive people.
And still the work goes on with success, and
even profit in nearly every case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania has been demonstrated, not
only the possibility but the wisdom of State
landlordism. To-day the State is a landlord
to the extent of over 15,000,000 acres, it has
16,000 tenants, and in all these resumptions,
divisions, settlements, rent collections and
management, there has been no loss, few
grievances and fewer scandals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, too, when the estates are cut up and
divided among settlers, schools are established,
post offices are opened, roads are made, and&mdash;when
needed by the settlers&mdash;money is
loaned to them by the State at a reasonably
low interest; and, so far, these laws have been
to the infinite advantage of the people, and a
profit to the State&mdash;the &lsquo;profits&rsquo; used to further
the general scheme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With this policy of graduated land tax
and discretionary resumptions, exorbitant rents
and land speculations are inconvenient, and
with the &lsquo;loan to the settler policy&rsquo; the money
sharks can&rsquo;t squeeze the people, &lsquo;they can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania, the State, or the people in their
organised capacity, aids from the general store
the people in their individual capacity&mdash;to help
themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The State gives nothing. There is humiliating
charity nowhere, but elevating justice
everywhere. The State puts a man on a
farm, loans him money, helps him up hill, and
then demands that he play the Hercules. It
will loan him a spade&mdash;not to lean upon or to
pawn, but to dig with&mdash;and he must keep it
bright and pay for its use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea in Zelania, my children, is to
have no lords and no paupers&mdash;that all men
shall be producers, and not vagrants; tax-payers,
and not tax-eaters&mdash;and that every
citizen shall become a sturdy democrat, who
will honorably strive as a stock-holder in a
paying concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joint encouragement is given,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and that may be called socialistic; but individual
action is demanded, and that is democratic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many persons in Zelania think that the
government train is rushing ahead too rapidly,
but these should observe the tendencies of the
times, and realise the advantages of the general
prosperity. Many others think the train
moves too slowly, but these should realise the
conservatism of wealth, the dangers of exploring
uncharted seas, and they should remember that
to-day, in all the essentials of human progress,
they are by far the most advanced of all
peoples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, there are occasional failures in
Zelania, enough to furnish healthy examples; for
while any man who will hustle may thrive, the
Almighty does not line up the jerseys for every
lout that likes cream in his chocolate. Even in
Zelania, the man who claims that this world
owes him a living must make some effort to
collect that little bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a fact, in Zelania they furnish a fellow
with about everything but brains. This, doubtless,
they would willingly do, but as there are a
few things in which Nature seems to practice
economy, so far there has appeared no surplus
of brains&mdash;no, not even in Zelania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here I cluster some of Mr. Oseba&rsquo;s graphic
conclusions into my own &ldquo;chaste&rdquo; language:&mdash;</p>

<p>Having become familiar with the serene
security of the man of acres in other lands, it is
curiously interesting to observe that people in
Zelania&mdash;common and no account as they are
in most countries&mdash;are held in considerable
respect, regardless of their bank accounts, or
the social position of their father-in-law.</p>

<p>In most countries, on Oliffa, the people are
&ldquo;moved on&rdquo; to make room for animals, and, in
most countries on Oliffa, the larger the &ldquo;estate,&rdquo;
the more easily can it be made larger; but in
Zelania, when too many people are &ldquo;out in
the cold,&rdquo; some fellow with a big paddock is
requested to &ldquo;set a price,&rdquo; and the stray
&ldquo;sheep&rdquo; are soon comfortably quartered and
employed.</p>

<p>Under the old system such &ldquo;estates&rdquo; were
always held &ldquo;sacred,&rdquo; but in Zelania, among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
most &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; of all recognised rights is the
&ldquo;sacred right&rdquo; of &ldquo;man to live&rdquo;; and it has been
discovered that to talk of the &ldquo;sacred right&rdquo; of
a man to live, without an opportunity to earn
something upon which to live, is an insult to
God&rsquo;s noblest creatures; and the graduated
land tax has so conciliated the lordly inheritors,
that the &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; who &ldquo;hunger and thirst&rdquo; are
not asked to wait for the platter of &ldquo;charity,&rdquo;
but they are &ldquo;filled&rdquo; from the products of their
own strong hands.</p>

<p>Here I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Christian Outeroos, my children,
all think they are in the world by the special
desire and fiat of God, and yet of all the
civilised Outeroos, the Zelanians alone have
had courage enough to demand standing
room on a world where God had placed
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They assume to think their deity made
the world and then made them to people it, yet
most of them have been persuaded that &lsquo;He
made the world&rsquo; for just a few of them, who are
privileged to put up the notice &lsquo;Keep off the
grass.&rsquo; The Zelanians alone have removed the
&lsquo;notice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While to us, my children, so far away,
with so long a history behind us, even these
measures seem but the cautious experiments of
amateurs, they are the most advanced known to
the Outeroos; and the Zelanians, in their
numerical &lsquo;fewness,&rsquo; their national youth, and
their splendid isolation, are more courageously
grappling with the difficulties that have baffled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the noblest statesmanship of all the ages, than
any other social group in the world&rsquo;s progressive
history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania, my children, is the most unmitigated
democracy ever known to the outer world
of this planet, yet her people have just gained a
glimpse, not a realisation, of human liberty.
But the divine flame from the sacred torch is
spreading, the public conscience is aroused, the
public intellect is alert, and the social train is
moving rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the dreamers, the poets, and the
academicians of other lands laud as social
ideals, the tradesmen, the farmers, and the
mechanics of Zelania discuss as every-day
matters of practical politics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Touch not the Lord&rsquo;s anointed&rsquo; hath
saved the head of many a despot, and touching
appeals for the observance of the &lsquo;sacred rights&rsquo;&mdash;in
hoary wrongs&mdash;hath larded the ribs of idleness
for a very protracted season, but the
Zelanians, in the exuberance of a novel situation,
are indulging in mental gymnastics, and
putting on grey matter&mdash;with results.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shipwrecked mariner, tossed on a lone
island, rich with food, and shelter, and material
for raiment, may &lsquo;own&rsquo; that little world&mdash;for a
time. His rights are supreme. He has a
&lsquo;vested interest.&rsquo; He &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; it. As a
contribution to the world&rsquo;s wealth he had
practically created that patch of dirt. It is his.
But suppose the next morning another fellow
from the same or some other ship is tossed
on the island. Well, number one must &lsquo;divvy.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
The social conditions have changed. &lsquo;Right&rsquo;
has a new definition&mdash;unless the first enslaves
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Definitions change. Right and wrong
as expressing the various social theories,
are fictions established by society for its own
use, and if a rule established by society for the
benefit of itself cannot be modified by society
for the benefit of a larger social self, one
man might own all the people who might be
cast on the island&mdash;even if the island became a
continent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Zelanians have discovered that
despotism consists chiefly in a loyal observance
of ancient customs, and they are giving
new definitions to old terms&mdash;and then adjusting
society upon the new definitions. In no country
are human rights more respected, or vested
interests more sacredly guarded, than in
Zelania, but the outposts are extended, and
no longer is the power of the few to legally
wrong the many, sanctified as a sacred
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania it has been decreed,&rdquo; said the
sage Oseba, &ldquo;that one man&rsquo;s rights must stop
where another&rsquo;s begins&mdash;especially if there are
several of the &lsquo;others.&rsquo; In Zelania it has been
decreed that the interests of &lsquo;all of us&rsquo; are paramount
to the interests of &lsquo;a few of us,&rsquo; and,
though the rights of no man must be infringed,
the equal rights of the many must not be withheld.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man is a social being, and how much of
his rights&mdash;as defined by himself&mdash;he may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
called upon to yield for the happiness of many&mdash;as
defined by themselves&mdash;has nowhere been
determined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania, my children, the people have
ideas, and the people rule. In Zelania the
people may ask the lucky fellow who first struck
the lonely island to &lsquo;set up a price.&rsquo; They may
ask that he who toils shall enjoy, that the size
of a paddock be decreased, that the distance
between drinks be increased, and, in Zelania,
the statesmen with fidelity carry out the will
of the people as expressed under the rules
prescribed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my children, I have dwelt with some
detail on the land system of Zelania, for of all
nations on the surface of Oliffa, the Zelanians
are gradually adjusting themselves most wisely
to the permanent happiness of the people&mdash;and
we may desire to send thither a &lsquo;colony.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania is a lovely land, my children, and,
were there no principle involved, I would like to
own it myself; but, alas! no &lsquo;principle&rsquo; should
be violated for so transient a pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SCENE_VIII_Act_III" id="SCENE_VIII_Act_III"></a><i>SCENE VIII&mdash;Act III.</i></h2>

<h3>UTILITARIAN.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Here</span> the notes record that there had been a
half-hour&rsquo;s recess, during which Leo Bergin
mentions that he enjoyed a pleasant
chat with the poetess Vauline, that she was
very charmingly inquisitive, and that while he
confessed his lack of eloquence as compared
with that of Oseba, he thought Zelania had lost
nothing through his modesty.</p>

<p>Leo remarks that he showed the poetess
many photos of the outer world, especially some
fine ones of Zelania&mdash;among others, some of the
leading statesmen and jurists&mdash;&ldquo;all at the same
sitting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I will ring off Leo Bergin, and have
Amoora Oseba continue his observations, as
per Leo&rsquo;s notes boiled down&mdash;by the fire of
genius.</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba, on rising, is noted to have
observed that men were human, to which I
partially agree.</p>

<p>Taking from the immortal Robert as a text,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man<br />
Makes countless thousands mourn,&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he delivered a long and eloquent oration
on man&rsquo;s relations to this world; how the
earth is the storehouse of Nature; how all
that we call wealth, and the things that contribute
to our health, comfort, and well-being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
are the products of the toil of men; and he
then observed how few of us get much exercise
out of this useful occupation.</p>

<p>As a fact, he conveyed the rather startling
information that, as relating to actual production,
fully nine-tenths of us were on vacation, or,
to put a point on it, that every toiler was carrying
about nine more easy-going souls on his
back. These remarks applied to general productive
industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba explains &ldquo;how in sparsely settled
countries, where there are animals, primitive
man lives by the chase, where there are tameable
animals he becomes partially tamed and lives
by his flocks, and where there is good soil&mdash;as
population increased&mdash;the people turn to agriculture,
and with more culture and more people
industry becomes specialised, and commerce
arises to put on the finishing touches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;as man clings to the
muscles with which his ancestors flapped their
ears, so he clings to all the habits practised
by man in the past. He lives by the chase as
long as there is room, he reduces nomadic
industry to a science, and by co-operation all
contribute to the advancement of the higher
ideal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania, save for sport, the chase has
been abandoned, and the living and wealth
come from herding on, delving into, or cultivating
the soil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gather from Leo&rsquo;s notes, that of some
66,000,000 acres of land in Zelania, there are
but 6,000,000 subdued by the plough, 1,400,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
acres in crops, 4,600,000 acres in grass, and
7,000,000 unploughed&mdash;also in exotic grasses&mdash;and
that chiefly from this source of wealth
800,000 of the best fed, best clothed, best housed,
best educated and best satisfied, most progressive,
healthy, happy and free people, that ever
loafed about on the surface of this planet are
quite alive, and satisfied to remain&mdash;<i>sine die</i>.</p>

<p>In grain and root crops, etc, the soil yields
more abundantly than that of any other country.
In pasture it carries more stock, in fruit it is
promising, and as for the dairy, Denmark must
fight to retain her laurels.</p>

<p>It will be seen that but a small portion of the
land of Zelania is devoted to its &ldquo;best use,&rdquo; so
there is room for many millions of people,
whose lot there should be blessed indeed, for in
no country is the fortune of the land dweller so
happy a one. His soil is fertile, his climate is
genial, his seasons are reliable, his health is
perfect, he has the best implements in use, his
taxes are light, and his prices are always good.
Happy Zelania&rsquo;s farmer!</p>


<h3>SOME THAT ADAM NAMED.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent epigraph">&ldquo;And God made the beasts of the earth after his
kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and God saw
that it was good.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>But only a few miserable little &ldquo;creeping
things&rdquo; got to Zelania, until the British
brought others.</p>

<p>Oseba, in a review of the &ldquo;animal business,&rdquo;
remarked, that as all animals&mdash;save the long-wooled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
goat herded on the desert and mountain
sides&mdash;had long retired from Cavitorus to make
room for people, he would use the terms
common among the Outeroos in his present
statement, leaving the more minute explanation
to be studied in his published report.</p>

<p>He claimed again that man had never been
able to work out a civilisation without the use
of tameable animals, and many of the Outeroos
had been most fortunate in these aids of Nature.</p>

<p>Where man had the association, company
and use of the camel, the horse, the ox, the
sheep, and the dog, he had been able to keep
up the march towards a higher goal. The
animals became at once servants, beasts of
burden, motive force, food and raiment.</p>

<p>The people about the Mediterranean, for
many thousands of years, had all these amiable
and useful animals. These animals carried
civilisation to the remotest parts of the world,
and from servants they became more a source of
commerce, food and raiment, than of motive force.</p>

<p>Rearing these animals became the chief
industry of Zelania early in her colonial days,
for the fertility of the soil, the healthfulness of
the country, the geniality of the climate, and
the ever reliability of the seasons, made this&mdash;of
all lands&mdash;the most suited for flocks and herds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my children,&rdquo; said Oseba, with animation,
&ldquo;had the Maoris possessed the horse,
the ox, and the sheep centuries ago, the dark
republic of the South Seas might have sent the
most eloquent diplomats to the opulent courts
of the Old World&mdash;but the Maori was alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>But let us back to the animals&mdash;and &ldquo;boil
them down.&rdquo; These 800,000 Zelanians have
20,250,000 sheep, 1,360,000 cattle, 280,000
horses, and 224,000 swine; and&mdash;well, there are
a few thousand, more or less, dogs. These
20,000,000 sheep are of a fine breed, reared with
the dual idea of good wool and good mutton;
they belong to about 19,000 persons, and they
yield, from export, an annual income of about
£5,000,000. There are 11,700 flocks of less
than 500 per flock, and 138 of over 20,000.
The Zelanians confess to having the best
mutton in the world.</p>

<p>I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania is a country of big things, only when
taken on the average. She has no millionaires
and no paupers. She has no sheep kings or
sheep thieves. She has big geysers, and big
Premiers, big yields, big people and big ideas,
but few big fortunes. They have &lsquo;trusts&rsquo; in
Zelania, but they are in God and&mdash;the people.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>PROFITABLE EXERCISE.</h3>

<p>Among the most pleasant as well as most
profitable industries anywhere, I conclude from
the notes, are dairying and fruit-growing, and
Mr. Oseba thinks that in no country or climate
on the upper crust of our planet are these industries
more promising or more profitable,
especially the former. The absence of cold
winters, the purity of the atmosphere, the
nutritiousness of the grasses, and the frequency
of rain, all &ldquo;work together for good&rdquo; to those
who attend to business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The relative area of land in Zelania
specially suitable for this purpose is enormous,
and as the fertility of the soil is improved
instead of being impoverished by this industry,
the possibilities of its development are incalculable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a person with moderate means this
seems the most tempting industry in this
charming land. Mining, too, with its variety
of products, the generous laws, the healthful
climate, the abundance of water, is a most
interesting and remunerative industry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mining laws and regulations are as
generous as the land laws, and in every undertaking
of this nature the policy of the Government
is, &lsquo;arm energy with the implements of
industry that wealth may come in response to
the kindly invitation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Zelanians were among the most
commercial people of the globe, considering
population, they entered into the spirit of railway
building in early times with great enthusiasm.
The railway mania began during the
reign of provincialism, and each province commenced
its little system without regard to the
plans of the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here a map was thrown on the wall, showing
different railway systems, with their different
routes and purposes. Considering the
nearness of the sea to every populous centre,
and the accessibility of these points for
steamers, the construction of costly railways
evidenced a commendable spirit of enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Doubtless, provincial pride and a willingness
to bid high for population in former times, that
rents on fine estates might be raised, had much
to do in stimulating this enterprise.</p>

<p>The railway lines were expensive, but they
have proved a good investment. I conclude
that at present Zelania has 2,325 miles of railway.
The road-bed is good, the rolling-stock
fair; travelling is about as comfortable as in
other countries, and the average passenger fare
is lower than in America. For the benefit of
the joint owners&mdash;the people&mdash;all &ldquo;profits&rdquo; go
to the general lowering of rates.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the Australasian colonies in
constructing, managing, and owning the transportation
lines cannot be too much admired,
Mr. Oseba thinks, especially as it was &ldquo;contrary
to the world&rsquo;s experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The orator argued logically, and in detail,
the wisdom of the public ownership of public
utilities, claiming that, as transportation was of
so vital an importance to all commercial
people, unless the Government owned and
operated the railways, the railways would, by
some means, own and operate the Government.</p>

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;Hongi,&rdquo; Maori Salutation.</i></p>
</div>

<p>He proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The railways in Zelania are a valuable
asset. Their construction has doubled the value
of the public lands, and, as at cheap rates they
are yielding a good per cent. on the total cost,
they are worth to-day the full amount of the
investment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The railways are being extended and improved
as rapidly as the demands require,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and the finances justify; and with the post
offices, telegraphs and telephones, they are
under the watchful eye and control of a Cabinet
Minister&mdash;at present Sir Joseph Ward&mdash;the
early evidence of whose sagacity was shown in
his having selected these antipodean regions
as a country in which to endure life&rsquo;s fitful
dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Joseph is an ornament too, as well as a
pillar in, the political and social structure of
Zelania. He is affable, polished, ambitious and
patriotic. He is brilliant in his business conceptions,
and, possessing a pleasing personality and
persuasive speech, he rarely fails in the execution
of his well organised designs. While he
has hardly passed the noon of life, he has long
been the skilful lieutenant of the sturdy Seddon,
and if the chief, at whose side he has so unfalteringly
stood, should weary under the burden
of public cares, it would seem most fitting that
the mantle of leadership should fall upon the
trained shoulders of this able and versatile
statesman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the construction of all the railways,
with all their <i>et ceteras</i>&mdash;the highways, bridges,
and other public works&mdash;is also directed by a
Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, from all the &lsquo;millions&rsquo; that have
been spent under this tireless guardian in the
promotion of these stupendous improvements,
in a country, too, in which very many intelligent
people would sit up &lsquo;all hours&rsquo; to find something
to criticise, there is probably not one
person who could be persuaded that there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ever a sixpence coined in His Majesty&rsquo;s Mint
sufficiently nimble to find its way into the wrong
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;Minister of Works&rsquo; works twice as
many hours per day as any one of the thousands
of men in his employ, and the thought of his
being influenced by any consideration save that
of the public good, could not be advanced to the
debatable stage in any company in Zelania.
These people trust their &lsquo;servants,&rsquo; and rarely,
indeed, is their trust betrayed. This is a
Zelanian &lsquo;trust.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly all these great works are carried on
under a co-operative policy, with a wage based on
individual capacity to earn, the work being
usually given to the &lsquo;unemployed&rsquo; nearest the
productive operations. It is claimed that this
policy has been no more costly than the old
contract system. It is of the people, for the
people, by the people.</p>

</div>

<p>Here, the notes record, the poetess Vauline
suggested that the sage Oseba give the audience
a little further information regarding Zelanian
statesmen, their relation to the Motherland, and
their hold upon the affections of the people.</p>

<p>In interesting detail, Mr. Oseba explained
that while Zelania claimed allegiance to the
British Crown, and that in defence of Britain&rsquo;s
honor she would pour out her blood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
treasure with Spartan valor, she was so proudly
free that should the same &ldquo;loved mother&rdquo;
demand a penny per pound tax on her tea, the
next rising sun would kiss a thousand emblems
of a new-born republic. For the Motherland,
Zelania would sacrifice all&mdash;save honor&mdash;but it
must be as a partner, and not as a vassal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no desire,&rdquo; said the orator, &ldquo;to
applaud the star performers of this great social
drama, for such leaders are but the chosen instruments
of the people, and as no other power
had conspicuously succeeded in establishing
justice among men, the people have the innings,
and may&mdash;yea, must&mdash;be trusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the chosen are not sure to enjoy the
&lsquo;affections of all,&rsquo; for as long as a man is
alive and in business,&rdquo; Mr. Oseba concludes,
&ldquo;there will be marked differences of opinion
regarding his mental and moral worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba &ldquo;caught on&rdquo; alright, for he
soon discovered that among the Outeroos the
real live man is always in somebody&rsquo;s way; that
the fellow who reached the persimmons, or &ldquo;got
there&rdquo;&mdash;at the top of the poll&mdash;was bad, and
that if such a one ever did a proper thing
it was through inadvertence, or from unholy
motives.</p>

<p>While a man &ldquo;is quite alive&rdquo; and wants
something, we scoff at his ability, we laugh at
his language, we question his motives, and we
wound him with our poisoned shafts. But let
him die once, and what a wondrous change! As
long as he is in our way, as long as his quivering
heart can feel, we cannonade him; then, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
we have wrapped him in the habiliments of
eternal silence, we feel subdued, we magnify
his virtues, and&mdash;<i>canonise</i> him.</p>

<p>Among a free and educated people, on questions
of domestic policy, there are always differences
of opinion among men, and this is no
imputation either on the intelligence or the
patriotism of the disputants; but Mr. Oseba
rather likes the man who gets there while the
other fellow is holding his caucus.</p>

<p>From these opposing opinions arise party
prejudices and factional strife, and earnestness
should be reckoned a virtue, even should the
reasoning finally prove faulty. Democracy,
then, instead of raising men above the human,
not infrequently reminds us how far men fall
short of the divine.</p>

<p>But on this point Mr. Oseba closes thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While Zelania is a conspicuous jewel of
the British Crown and very red on the map,
and her government is of, for, and by
the people, any praise of her statesmen is a
compliment to the character and intelligence of
the &lsquo;ultimate power&rsquo;&mdash;the people.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>LET&rsquo;S TO BUSINESS.</h3>

<p>Here, for the sake of brevity, I condense
many eloquent pages, and for the sake of clearness
I make Mr. Oseba&rsquo;s story my own, quoting
when we pass the general argument.</p>

<p>Commercially, I conclude, Zelania, on a
population basis, is one of the leading countries
on the upper crust, her annual exports
and imports amounting to about £24,000,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
To furnish financial convenience for the great
industrial and commercial enterprise of the
country, there are provided excellent banking
facilities. As a fact, the capital invested in
banking, for so small a society, seems fabulous.
The banking laws are explicit, and while the
banks have provided for their own perfect safety,
they cannot, if they should desire, oppress the
people. But the fact that advances by these
banks amount to about £20 per cap. of the
whole people shows to what extent they are
patronised.</p>

<p>Referring to a review of the political side
of this country, it appears that the Zelanians,
all in all, have the most rational system of taxation
of any people anywhere. With a desire to
encourage &ldquo;home industry,&rdquo; and also influenced
by custom, the laws provide that the necessary
revenue be raised by the usual methods, direct
and indirect taxation, but it is of the former
I shall chiefly speak. Of the total, say
£3,113,000, about 74 per cent. is raised by
indirect methods, or from taxes on imports and
excises, while 26 per cent. is raised by a direct
tax on land and income.</p>

<p>On land and income the taxes are graduated,
the rates increasing with the increase of the income,
or the value of the estate&mdash;those on land
being on the unimproved value. This system of
graduated taxation is a new departure, a reversal
of the history of the ages. It is based upon the
idea of social defence of personal rights. It is
plain that the more property a person possesses
the greater are his claims upon society for protection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and the graduated tax is simply demanding
extra rent for extra room, or extra charge for
the extra expense for the extra security given.
In fact, it is extra insurance for extra risks.</p>

<p>The justice of the idea has been clear to
thoughtful men&mdash;who had nothing to tax&mdash;for
many years; but in Zelania&mdash;to discover a new
truth means to occupy a new position. Zelania
does not allow her intellectual jewels to rust in
the brains of the academician.</p>

<p>Under Zelania&rsquo;s novel policy the books show
her to be carrying a public debt greater in proportion
to population than any other country,
but for every shilling of her debt she has more
than two shillings in valuable assets, and for
most of it she has a reproductive asset. So, as
a fact, the burden helps to carry the people.
Like other &ldquo;heavily involved&rdquo; Australasian
States, if measured by the rule of other nations,
she is among the least burdened of all people.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
&ldquo;And these people were cunning in handicraft.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Oseba tells his audience at some length
about the manufacturing industries of Zelania,
but a small space will suffice, as it is better to
remember the haste of the age. The pith is,
that considering the newness of the country,
and the narrow limits of the markets, there has
been a laudable advance in manufacturing enterprise.
The chief industries, of course, have
developed from the most common and profitable
material resources of the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;we are never
done with Zelania&rsquo;s wonders. While she offers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the most tempting rewards for effort, she gives
nothing ready-made. In all Zelania there was,
and is, nothing of the &lsquo;Arise, Peter, slay and
eat&rsquo; to be found, but everywhere there is seen:
&lsquo;In my treasure-house there are many jewels,
and he who cannot open my door and unlock
my chest would be an unsafe custodian of my
riches, an unworthy recipient of my favors.&rsquo;
Or, like the gay and mischievous maiden who
says, &lsquo;Catch me, and you have a kiss,&rsquo; she
keeps all her promises. Relying on Nature
without effort, any man in Zelania might genteelly
starve; but relying on effort with Nature&rsquo;s
aid, any man in Zelania may live like a prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania had no indigenous animals, and
really no indigenous grasses, and her fruits were
meagre, but she had the magic force of fecundity,
and she said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
&lsquo;I am the nourisher. Like the wise virgins<br />
I have long waited a worthy wooer.<br />
By action, arose I from the mad seas&rsquo; bosom.<br />
By action, arose my heaven-piercing mountains.<br />
By action, were my rivers dug, and plains fertilised.<br />
By action, created I and concealed my mineral wealth;<br />
And, loving &ldquo;action,&rdquo; to him who gives an ounce of sweat,<br />
I pledge a pound of glittering gold.&rsquo;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, as Zelania&rsquo;s laws give pound for
pound of private contribution to worthy causes,
so Zelania&rsquo;s goddess of fortune gives to honest
toil a reward of many fold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania offers nothing for sloth, everything
for industry. Her treasures are all
hidden, but a plough reveals them. Tickle a
field with a harrow, and it laughs with a crop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a hundred bushels to the acre. Remove a fern,
a sprig of clover comes. Bring a little rabbit
to &lsquo;amuse the boys,&rsquo; and, lo! Nature is so
pleased that the &lsquo;boys&rsquo; have to hustle to save
the crops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as Zelania, by every feature of her
nature, suggests action, her people are exploring
every field of industrial enterprise. Though
wages are high and the market for most of the
manufactured goods very limited, there has been
reasonable success in many branches of the arts
productive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, the chief of these industries,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;relate to what might be called raw
pastoral products: meat, wool, butter, and
cheese. The list of manufactures include some
twenty general classes, covering over one hundred
sub-classes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a rule, the manufacturing plants are
fairly well equipped&mdash;the machinery for the meat
and dairy works being especially up to date.
The wages of the 41,000 persons employed are,
high. Nearly £8,000,000 are invested in plant,
and the annual output amounts to £17,000,000.
Certainly these facts speak strongly for the
enterprise of so new a people.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
&ldquo;But, Zelania, &rsquo;twas not thy &lsquo;riches&rsquo; nor thy trade,<br />
&rsquo;Twas not thy fields, thy fruits, thy wool that made<br />
Thee loved of gods and men, nor gold; nor stately domes.<br />
&rsquo;Twas &lsquo;justice,&rsquo; inscribed on the portals of thy homes.<br />
For thou first learned that men and women must be great,<br />

<h3>THE MORAL SIDE.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Relating</span> to the moral side of Zelania&rsquo;s
progress, the notes were very full, but the
story will be briefly and chiefly told in the
less chaste style of Marmaduke:&mdash;</p>

<p>As a rule, the people of Zelania, if the great
discoverer is correct, enjoy excellent health&mdash;or
should enjoy it&mdash;though we rarely &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo;
anything that is very common. Of course,
Zelania has not yet evolved a type, though she
has begun her task, for while the Zelanians are
of excellent stock, the &ldquo;born Zelanian&rdquo; is said
to be superior, both in physical fibre and mental
perception, to the average person of the Motherland.
Nature, Mr. Oseba thinks, will preserve
the &ldquo;sorrel hair,&rdquo; the white skin, the florid complexion,
the fine shoulders and the firm &ldquo;understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Zelanians are loyal to the Motherland.
They speak of Britain as &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; and, as a
compliment to her, the color with which she
paints her dependencies is conspicuously present
in the cheeks of Zelanian ladies.</p>

<p>Unless Zelania dilutes her blood by hurried
accessions to her population, she will, in a few
generations, furnish the finest type of mental
and physical man and womanhood that ever
kicked a football, or &ldquo;did the block,&rdquo; on the
surface of Oliffa.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">

<p class="center"><i>Maori Wharepuni.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>In the care of the unfortunate, the deaf, the
dumb, the blind, and the lunatics, Zelania is
already on the &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo; side, as Mr. Oseba
abundantly testifies.</p>

<p>Oseba says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As an evidence of the satisfaction of the
people of Zelania with their present condition,
it is only necessary to remark the low death rate
among the people. This for the last eleven years
has averaged less than ten persons per thousand.
For the same period, the rates in Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden, were about sixteen per
thousand; in the United Kingdom, over eighteen
per thousand; in Germany and France, about
twenty-two per thousand; in Italy, about twenty-five;
and in Austria, over twenty-seven per
thousand. Then it appears that of all people
the Zelanians are best satisfied with their
present situation.&mdash;Mayhap, some tarry even a
little too long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While these people are all earnest, and
want to go to heaven&mdash;afterwhile&mdash;they seem to
be in no hurry about starting, and have little
desire for risking climatic changes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With other matchless wonders, had Nature
been attending properly to business, she would
have placed the &lsquo;Fountain of Youth&rsquo; in some of
these charming spots, for the &lsquo;untimely taking
off&rsquo; of a person in Zelania seems quite unjustifiable.
A person willingly leaving any other
country might be justified in making the change,
but when anyone permanently retires from Zelania
it means there has been coercion, an exercise
of some extraneous power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange, but the books show seventy-nine
suicides to have been committed in one year
in Zelania, though it seems incredible that any
person in Zelania should voluntarily retire. Of
course, they may have desired to get to heaven
ahead of some of their neighbors, for in Zelania
they like to be considered a little advanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To insure or secure the public health,
there are wise sanitary laws, charitable institutions
and hospitals; the practice of medicine
is wisely guarded, and carried on by able
physicians. In all these public affairs, the
Government&mdash;which means the people in
their organised capacity&mdash;is most generous in
its assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In local hospitals, or charitable enterprise,
the Government usually gives pound for pound
for all private contributions, and the many
institutions of the kind in all Australasia furnish
a pleasing surprise to observing travellers.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>&ldquo;ON THE MAKE.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Mr. Oseba was greatly interested in the
&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; of the Outeroos. I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have visited all the countries of the
upper crust of Oliffa, and I have observed that
the Outeroos are taking a lot of physical exercise.
They are engaged in a mad scramble
for dollars. Just why any man should want so
many &lsquo;dollars&rsquo; is not very clear, but it is very
clear that they do want them. Men with very
many dollars are, in most things, much like the
men with very few dollars; they are alarmed at
smallpox, the cold and the heat make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
thirsty, and the shapely actress turns alike their
shallow heads. Then, too, the grim chariot
that carries waste from the &lsquo;City of Confusion&rsquo;
and deposits it in the &lsquo;City of the Silent,&rsquo; calls
about as promptly at the mansion of Lady
Bountiful as at the hovel of the laundress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the man of dollars dies, he is about as
dead as his footman&mdash;under like circumstances.
He&rsquo;ll be dead about as long, and whatever his
facilities for the transfer of wealth while in
active business, he can take none of it with him.
But, maybe, &rsquo;tis well, for if the old story be
true, it would probably melt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world has been aroused by the magic
force of modern genius, and is being unified
by Anglo-Saxon commercial enterprise. The
nations are growing wealthy; gold is the sole
object of ambition, of toil, of production, of
trade. For gold the industrious strive, the duke
marries, the boss robs, the politician &lsquo;negotiates,&rsquo;
the lawyer deceives, the judge decrees,
the noble cheats, and the &lsquo;parson&rsquo;&mdash;takes up a
collection. In this enormous confusion, a great
many people get a lot of exercise&mdash;a few, &lsquo;clip
the coupons,&rsquo; and are happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the superior Outeroos are only veneered
pagans, my children, and gold is the universal
god. When Moses smashed the &lsquo;golden calf&rsquo;
the fragments must have been many, and each
tiny piece must have multiplied into many full-grown
bullocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This deity, however, should never grow
&lsquo;jealous.&rsquo; His worshippers have at least one
sturdy virtue, for among all the millions of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
there kneels not one hypocrite. While the
other deities are occasionally scoffed and often
neglected, the &lsquo;golden calf&rsquo; is always in
evidence. But he attends to business, and in
all places he hath wonderful potency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genius has quickened the hand of toil,&rdquo;
said Oseba, &ldquo;but it has not removed the callous,
and almost everywhere on the surface of Oliffa
the opulence of the mansion tells the wretchedness
of the hovel. The owner of the one
schemes, the tenant of the other toils. The
man who toils, toils for another; the man who
&lsquo;schemes&rsquo;&mdash;well, the other fellow goes to him
for a cheque at the end of the week. Until the
great democracies of the Antipodes were established,
every government of the world, regardless
of title, style or form, conspired with cunning
to rob credulity, with the schemer to rob
the toiler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thus reasoned, my children, that
you might realise by &lsquo;looking upon this picture
and then upon this,&rsquo; that Zelania has introduced
to the world a social policy under which the
people, in their organised capacity, have secured
to the people, in their individual capacity, a
fuller measure of the fruits of their
mental and physical efforts than was ever
enjoyed in any other country under the
sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not even a policy of the &lsquo;greatest
good to the greatest number,&rsquo; for, as the purest
happiness consists in a participation of the
general joy, it is a policy of the greatest good
to all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania&rsquo;s motto is: &lsquo;He who earns shall
have, and he who strives shall enjoy.&rsquo; In this,
the people builded better than they knew, and
soon Zelania will be the most conspicuously
conspicuous spot on Oliffa, and thousands of
people will visit her marvellous shores, not more
to enjoy the museums of the gods than to study
the customs and the character of the first nation
of emancipated men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania, though she is now the foremost
among the world&rsquo;s social pioneers, was practically
wrested from Nature by the present generation
of men. The Zelanian Isles were Nature&rsquo;s
last best gift to the noblest race of her noblest
creatures&mdash;the gods seeming to have waited for
a proper tenantry for these more than Elysian
fields.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania, my children, is the John in the
Wilderness&mdash;the prophesied of old, the prophet
of the new. She is the beacon of the present,
the divine torch of the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, that is inspiring! Let&rsquo;s take an amateur
&ldquo;soar.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
To the Goddess of Justice their prayers are read.<br />

</div>

<p>Pardon; let&rsquo;s back to Leo&rsquo;s notes, for Mr.
Oseba&rsquo;s modest candour better suits this prosy
age.</p>


<h3>SHE CAME&mdash;FINALLY.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent epigraph">&ldquo;And the Lord God said, &lsquo;It is not well that man
should be alone; I will make him a help-meet for him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Without irreverence, I would regard this as
an excellent idea.</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba, say the notes, gave a most
pleasing review of the domestic relations of the
Outeroos, with special reference to the position
of women.</p>

<p>The notes on this pleasing phase of the
oration were full and spirited, but in boiling
down some dozen pages I will array the orator&rsquo;s
impressions in my own garb, as though I myself
had learned something on this interesting theme.</p>

<p>The stronger and more haughty among the
Outeroos are called men, while the more frail,
gentle and loquacious are called wo-man, which
means that in some way these latter are to be
&ldquo;wooed and won&rdquo; before reaching the final end
of existence.</p>

<p>In old times, man won these fair creatures in
a race for life. They &ldquo;wooed them&rdquo; with a
bludgeon, captured, and dragged them to a
hut, and chained them to the door-post until
they were &ldquo;persuaded&rdquo; to stew the oysters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
But this woman, with a shrewdness she is said
to have retained even to this day, cunningly
devised a trap into which she knew her &ldquo;lord
and master&rdquo;&mdash;an epithet that has survived the
wreck of empires&mdash;would place his brogan.</p>

<p>From the waste of the &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo; she
fertilised the soil at the roots of a heavy grass,
and it grew into a grain. She moistened a plant,
and it opened into a fruit. She tamed the
young animal&mdash;brought for the stew&mdash;and it
became the faithful dog. By a cushion of moss
she softened the log used by her lord as a pillow,
and, on his return with terrapin and salmon
berries, she looked into his swarthy face and
smiled.</p>

<p>He was impressed. He took her gently by
the hand, pressed her to his palpitating bosom,
and, looking into her deep liquid eyes, he said,
&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; He broke the chains that bound
her, and, the wrist fetters being stubborn, he
polished them into bracelets&mdash;and these are still
worn as a rudiment of the earlier times. What
&ldquo;Papa&rdquo; might say came later. The twain
became one flesh&mdash;which one, has always been
debatable.</p>

<p>Then it was arranged, with very considerable
limitation, that they should be partners. She,
the wooed-man, or woman, was to love, to serve,
to obey, while he&mdash;furnished the superintendence.</p>

<p>The old system dropped out of use many
centuries ago, and the new was a change, largely
in form, hardly in fact.</p>

<p>The old fetters have rusted in the museums
of the past. The club, that potent persuader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
old, has been presented to the champion of the
base-ball team, and the woman is at large. But
as the priest now signs and sanctifies the bond,
the change, in most countries, is still chiefly in
the character of the fetters.</p>

<p>All people have traditions that help to justify
the stronger in acts of oppression, and to conciliate
the weaker in their vassalage.</p>

<p>But civilisation has grown&mdash;only with the
emancipation of women. Just as the fetters
have been removed from the brain, and soul,
and conscience of woman, has the social ideal
risen, has arbitrary force weakened, and have
feeling and reason prevailed. The woman is
the mother; from hereditary and prenatal influences
come form and character.</p>

<p>How can a mother, with the feeling of inferiority,
a feeling of subdued dependence, with
no courage nor conscious individuality, bring
forth brave, independent, high-minded offspring?
Only by emancipated mothers can full-statured
men be reared, and thus has the race crawled
slowly forward.</p>

<p>For the snail-like pace of human progress,
the world is more indebted to the past and
political inequalities of the sexes than to all
other retarding influences combined.</p>

<p>With the progress of science, with the
physical forces of Nature harnessed by mental
exploits, the relative positions of human
muscle and human sentiment are changing,
and, with a cultured reason, deeper affections
and higher ideals invariably appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Here I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania, women are &lsquo;people,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr.
Oseba, &ldquo;and liberty and social rights are not
limited to any particular cut of the garments.
In Zelania, the mother, the wife, and the
daughter stand proudly erect with the father,
the husband, and the brother&mdash;and still the
seasons come and go, the showers are as usual
damp, the fruits ripen in due course of time,
the fair &lsquo;fellow-elector&rsquo; is as greatly surprised
at the suddenness of the long-hoped-for question,
papa is invoked as of yore, and the gay
old world swings merrily on her uneventful
voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania, my children, the women vote,
and claim equal political rights with those who
buy the opera tickets and set up the ice cream.
Of course, they don&rsquo;t go to Parliament, save at
the sittings, to which they bring their loving
smiles and their sewing but they are on their
way, and they will get there all the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But with the coming of women few
changes have been noted&mdash;so few of the hopes
or fears of the ages have been realised. Woman
does not wear spurs&mdash;she has not got out of her
place&mdash;and she does not do the sights, as does
her hubby, and swear she was detained at the
&lsquo;ledger.&rsquo; She has not become masculine, for
she is still the gentle mother of the children,
and she is still the same dear old mother, or
wife, sister, or lover as of yore, when Zeus said,
&lsquo;Behold! when the fair smile, victory is nigh.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But neither have all the hopes, so confidently
cherished, been fully realised. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
not been discovered&mdash;so &rsquo;tis said&mdash;that the
&lsquo;political atmosphere&rsquo; has materially changed;
that legislators are greatly altered in personal
character; that social ethics have been revolutionised;
or, to the surprise of many, that the
distance between drinks has been materially
lengthened. But, whatever the means, great
changes come slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a fact, the experience of Zelania, at
three parliamentary elections, rather indicates
that on social, political, economic, and moral
questions, the men and women of the country
are &lsquo;tarred&rsquo; with about the same brush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in this reform there is a sense of
justice and a conscious largeness of soul that
is mentally exhilarating, and must result favorably
to society everywhere. In the air of
Zelania all fetters rust away, and the flag of
a new victory, won over traditional custom and
selfishness, having been unfurled in this noble
land, people afar will first dream, then hesitate,
then inquire, and then conclude to have a reshuffling
of the cards in this doubtful game of
life.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>INTELLECTUAL TASTES.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;If Zelania is proud of her system of education,
she may be forgiven,&rdquo; was Oseba&rsquo;s first
reference to the intellectual ambition of her
people. He was eloquent on this subject. As
any thinker could &ldquo;guess,&rdquo; the Zelanians were
certainly not slow in efforts to elevate the
mental tastes or in making provisions for the
education of the future citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The foundation of the present excellent school
system was laid by the old provincial authorities,
and the best hopes of the pioneers, those who
believed in &ldquo;teaching the young ideas how to
shoot,&rdquo; are being beautifully realised.</p>

<p>The orator says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At present 82 per cent. of the people of
Zelania have the rudiments of education, which,
considering the pioneer character of the country,
&lsquo;speaks volumes&rsquo; for the community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are over 2,000 schools in the colony,
with an attendance of about 150,000 pupils.
Of these schools some 1,600 are free, and all
children from seven to fourteen years of age are
required to attend them. The natives, also, are
supplied with 96 of these free primary schools,
at which 4,500 pupils attend. Rather new;
but the railways carry the children free to and
from the nearest school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the primary schools, besides the usual
branches, such as reading, writing, arithmetic,
geography, grammar, and history, the elementary
sciences, and drawing, the girls are taught
sewing and domestic economy, and the boys are
drilled as &lsquo;military heroes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides these free primary schools there
are many higher secondary schools, supported
partly by the Government and partly by &lsquo;fees,&rsquo;
and many more private and denominational
schools of a very good order. As a rule, one
religious denomination&mdash;the Roman Catholics&mdash;decline
to very generally patronise the public
schools, and this church supports independently
a large number of excellent educational institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
There are eight technical or art schools,
at which some 3,000 young persons attend, a
majority of them finishing their school life at
this stage. The branches taught at these
schools, and the subjects of examination, cover
a broad field, and the young person who becomes
proficient in them may be regarded as
fairly well equipped for most of the battles of
this active age. At these schools a young
person is armed with the &lsquo;practical,&rsquo; with little
danger of being over &lsquo;stuffed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a fact, my children,&rdquo; said Mr. Oseba,
&ldquo;many countries on the upper crust are filled
with educated dunces, who are mentally deformed
by over-cramming, and who are inspired
by the hopes of living on &lsquo;sheepskin&rsquo;; but as
Zelania has practically no rich or leisured class,
the basic idea of school-day training is to fit the
rising generation, not for ornamental, but for
practical service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania, as a capstone of her educational
edifice, has a university, which was instituted by
Act of Parliament in 1874, not for the purpose
of teaching, but for encouraging a liberal education.
This university is an examining, scholarship-awarding,
and degree-granting institution,
and the responsibility for the success of university
work rest mainly with the four affiliated
teaching colleges, which have a curricula in
science, arts, medicine, law, mining, engineering
and agriculture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there are industrial schools, schools
for the blind, deaf, and dumb, which, taken all
in all, constitute a splendid system, all being
carried on at heavy expense to the State. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the general high character of the people, their
usual bearing and manners, the average moral
tone, and absence, in the main, of coarseness
and vulgarity, tell strongly for the merits of the
educational system of the country, as well as
for the natural and social influences that mould
society.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>OTHER &ldquo;TASTES.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>With the next phase of Zelanian life, according
to the notes of Leo Bergin, Oseba was
deeply impressed and pleased, for he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As might be expected, my children, in a
land so blessed by Nature, occupied by so noble
a race, and ruled by such incomparably wise
and generous laws, the word &lsquo;pauper&rsquo; is not
found in Zelanian statistics, and the &lsquo;criminals,&rsquo;
considering the newness of the country, are few
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking of the character of crime, Oseba
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vice and virtue, my children, are largely
questions of sensation. The actions of men that
produce disagreeable sensations&mdash;immediate or
remote&mdash;we call vices, while the opposite we
call virtues. We are the product of experience.
Vice is the guide board to virtue&mdash;the danger
signal. Without vice there would be no definition
for virtue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But taste has much to do in guiding a
people. The Zelanians have a taste for knowledge,
but they have other tastes. The Christian
Outeroos are thirsty, and the Zelanians are
Outeroos. Strange, but in a single year there
were over 7,000 of these noble Zelanians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
arrested for their earnest efforts to satisfy this
peculiar infatuation. This seems incredible, for
while there are several persons in Zelania who
are never known to be thirsty, there are about
7,000,000 gallons of beer used annually in filling
the &lsquo;alimentary canal&rsquo; of the Zelanians. Just
why, with so goodly a supply, with so short a distance,
both in time and space, between drinks,
this peculiar sensation should turn the heads of
men, is not very clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many very well-meaning people believe
there would be less &lsquo;arrests&rsquo; for these peculiar
freaks should the distance between drinks be
extended, but others, having considerable interest
in the matter, hold that most of these
confused persons are &lsquo;taken in&rsquo; during their
long search for somebody to do the &lsquo;shouting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; Oseba said, &ldquo;there is a pleasing
side, for while 51 per cent. of the population
over fifteen years of age were born in Zelania,
this portion is said to have furnished but 17 per
cent. of the Court&rsquo;s takings for this confusing
recreation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For other crimes, the 51 per cent. of native-born
furnish but 28 per cent. of the law breakers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be, my children, that the 49 per
cent. of the foreign born, who are said to
furnish the other per cent. of the &lsquo;takings,&rsquo; are
only celebrating their arrival in so glorious a
country&mdash;a country in which a day&rsquo;s earnings,
it is said, will pay for many beers. At any rate,
the native-born Zelanian seems the better man,
for he either &lsquo;calls&rsquo; less frequently or &lsquo;carries
his load&rsquo; better than the &lsquo;new chum.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>But all are thirsty, Mr. Oseba, and the
&ldquo;practice at the bar,&rdquo; if not profitable, is
exhilarating.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">They think they want a drink.<br />
When it&rsquo;s wet they want a drink.<br />
When it&rsquo;s dry they want a drink.<br />
When it&rsquo;s warm, and when it&rsquo;s cold;<br />

They think, and when they think,<br />
They want a drink.<br />
When they&rsquo;re sick, and when they&rsquo;re well,<br />
Bound for heaven or for &mdash;&mdash;,<br />
Then they think&mdash;they want a drink.<br />
But do they think when e&rsquo;er they drink?<br />
Or does the drink confuse the think?</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But the fact,&rdquo; said Mr. Oseba, &ldquo;that in
one year there were twelve homicides is most
surprising to the inquiring stranger. Surely no
man well &lsquo;quartered&rsquo; in Zelania should care to
be killed, and the reckless head that would plan,
or the ruthless hand that would execute a design
to close a life in Zelania, should in some manner
be restrained from so fell a purpose. Deducting
the homicides of foreign birth, however, it leaves
for the Zelanians the cleanest record in the
&lsquo;Christian&rsquo; world&mdash;as one would expect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Zelanians, my children, are usually
glad they are alive, and, too, they are usually
willing to allow others to remain and enjoy the
entertainment.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>INTELLECTUAL GYMNASTICS.</h3>

<p>The notes relating to Zelanian art and
literature were very full, and they were complimentary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
&rsquo;Tis said that art develops only
with age, and that while the aspect of Nature
may appeal to the poetic or artistic imagination,
art arises from dominant ideas, from deeply-seated
sentiments, and as in new, active, progressive,
and commercial countries the dominant
ideas do not lend themselves to reverie, and
could not be feelingly expressed on canvas, art
in Zelania must be &ldquo;imported&rdquo; for a season.
But literature has come, and literature is civilisation.</p>

<p>The notes continue:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Literature, or, to broaden the theme and
say the taste for knowledge and for general reading
in Zelania, deserves many compliments.
While there is not, as yet, a literature bearing
a distinctive stamp of Zelanian genius, many
volumes with real merit, both in prose and
verse, have been written, and the topics show
a versatile taste, knowledge, and imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While from the very nature of things
Zelania must be a land of romance, poesy, and
song, of the stage, of the race, and the hall,
yet from the sturdiness of the stock there must
first come a sufficiency of works of a graver
character as the present exuberance of society
tones down toward restful meditation. To-day
Zelania is &lsquo;waltzing,&rsquo; to-morrow she will walk,
and next week she will think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania has many well-managed libraries,
and, considering the population, the Zelanians
buy, pay for, and read, more books than any
other people on earth. The kind of books?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Well, just the kind that any student would
expect&mdash;trash, the most of it, as trashy trash is
the taste of the times, everywhere.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_250.jpg" width="450" height="348" alt="Silica terraces" />
<p class="center"><i>Silica Terraces, Orakei Korako, between Rotorua and Taupo.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But it shows the desire for reading, and,
as these children grow older, a more sober class
of books will find its way from the shelves to
the desk of the reader. Even now in Zelania
the taste for blood and thunder literature is
waning, while gay and chaste humour, with
glimpses of the philosophy of life, is in growing
favor. The heart of a nation may be seen
through its laws, but the heart, and the soul,
and the laws are the product of national
literature. Literature is civilisation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Zelanians are a new community&mdash;the
people have but recently come together&mdash;society
is in a &lsquo;stew,&rsquo; as the members have but little
mutual &lsquo;acquaintance,&rsquo; and as the new environment,
the air, and the aspect of Nature suggest
hilarity, all the sermonising in the world would
not convert this Zelanian &lsquo;holiday&rsquo; into a
prayer-meeting. In the Zelanian character
there appears the sparkling diamond, and in
the Zelanian fibre there are also the oak and
the steel that will tell in the morrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As an evidence of the mental appetite, or
the reading habit, the 800,000 Zelanians have
and support 200 newspapers, several of which
rank with the great journals of the globe, and
the average tone of no press in the world is
higher than that of Zelania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True to the racial defects,&rdquo; Oseba said,
&ldquo;the Zelanians, like the Australians and the
Americans, are not linguists. These wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
people seem neither desirous nor capable of
speaking &lsquo;strange tongues.&rsquo; With brief experience,
I thought this unfortunate, but I
gradually changed my mind, for not only is
the world coming to the use of the English
speech,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> but as &lsquo;silence is golden,&rsquo; and it is
manifestly easier to keep quiet in one than in
several languages, this weakness has a virtuous
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often noticed while abroad how
prone are the masters of many tongues, when
striving to keep silent in one, to break out in
some less euphoneous speech, and thus give
themselves away, or at least arouse a contagious
smile of good-natured disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mental gymnastics in Zelania have
produced a high order of visible results.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though the country is very new in all
phases of modern being, political, social,
judicial, educational and religious, it possesses
a wonderfully symmetrical form. For its present
splendid condition the country is indebted to the
efforts of men who were themselves the products
of hard but happy and interesting colonial life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New and distant as this country is, narrow
as has been the political, industrial and social
horizon, by the vigor of inherited pluck and the
resistless persuasiveness of the romantic environment,
in physical courage, in moral stamina
and in intellectual force, Zelania&rsquo;s leading men
will compare well with those trained in the great
world&rsquo;s historic centres.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The present Premier, who has guided the
ship of State during more than ten years of
its most wonderful progress, graduated in the
rugged school of industrial activity, and, casting
off the implements of custom and delusion, he
not only made Zelania a more conspicuously red
patch on the world&rsquo;s map, but himself became
a recognised force in the Councils of Empire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But with others than her progressive statesmen,
Zelania is rich in sturdy manhood and
ability&mdash;grey matter. Her schools and colleges
rank well with the educational institutions of
older and richer countries; her instructors are
profoundly learned; her judiciary, with its
present head, would adorn the bench of the
Motherland itself; and her professionals in law
and medicine, if cast in a body in any other
country, would not lower the average.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my children, as yet not all the milestones
are statues; not all who loaf in the parks
are poets, nor are all who stroll in the streets philosophers,
but according to the prevailing notion in
Zelania, this noble aspiration will soon be realised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These, my children, though I drank not
with the statesmen, I came not before the
courts, I &lsquo;feed&rsquo; no solicitor, and my health was
perfect during my sojourn in Zelania, were my
impressions on these themes.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>FOR OPINION&rsquo;S SAKE.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent epigraph">&ldquo;Let your light so shine before men, that they may
see your good works.&rdquo; (Usually obeyed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>)</p>
</div>

<p>Under this head the notes were full and
clear, but as life grows shorter and space less, I
will condense greatly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Amoora Oseba informs his audience that the
Zelanians have considerable religion&mdash;in fact,
there seems to be nearly enough to go round,
for all save a very few are reported to have it in
some of its various forms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the 800,000 people, nearly all,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;belong to some religious society, and about all
who claim God as a father, seem to think it
necessary to regard the church as a mother&mdash;so
few do business direct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the various creeds, the Church of
England claims about 40 per cent. of the
whole; the Presbyterian 22; and the Roman
Catholic, 14 per cent. There are nearly 1,000
clergymen in Zelania, said to be gentlemen of
excellent attainments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As would be expected from so free and
civilised a people, there is among all classes
and creeds in Zelania a commendable spirit of
common brotherhood and toleration. As a fact,
members of the various creeds drink at the same
bar and attend the same football match, though,
being so reared, they desire to go to heaven by
different trains. All seem to strive together for
the general good, dividing, by common consent,
as to methods for the accomplishment of the one
desired aim. The Roman Catholics, however,
that their followers may be so instructed that
they will be sure to &lsquo;select the proper train,&rsquo;
usually provide their own schools, while contributing,
through general taxation, to the support
of most of the others. Probably in no
country so universally religious is there so little
creed prejudice or intolerance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But political and social emancipation
everywhere gives a man a conscious dignity
and worth that places him in closer harmony
with the infinite, and tells for sympathy, love,
and charity. The people are religious, but not
bigoted. The are religious, but they do not
superstitiously cringe, and, as they have been
specially guided, they express no disfavor with
the methods of the Deity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a fact, like all well regulated people,
the Zelanians pray, but, instead of prostrating
themselves, they stand bravely erect, and, considering
themselves the crowning act of the
creative power, they congratulate the Almighty
on the excellence of His handiwork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the poetess Vauline inquired if all the
people among the superior Outeroos worshipped
the same deity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my children,&rdquo; said the sage Oseba,
with candor, &ldquo;on Sundays. On Sundays the
Christian Outeroos meet in comfortable places
and worship the one true God. On the other
days, many people give a lot of attention to
another deity. This every-day deity&mdash;by
persons who praise lavish generosity in other
people&mdash;is spoken of very slightingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This deity is worshipped by many people
under many names, but the Americans, among
whom it is said&mdash;abroad&mdash;he hath great influence,
spell it this way&mdash;$. It may be doubtful,
however, if the Americans really care more for
the smiles of this deity than others, but they
get up earlier. From tradition the Christian
Outeroos call him Mammon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
though he is denounced very much by pious
lips, he is considerably in evidence in very holy
places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my children, these observations
do not apply to the Zelanians. But the Outeroos
are growing wiser, stronger, nobler, and better,
and the people are inclining to the notion that
he who serves man most, pleases God best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right, Mr. Oseba! The world grows better,
and more truly religious as it grows wiser.</p>

and the audience, feeling refreshed, showed deep
interest in a problem, the solution of which had
taxed the best energies of the ablest statesmen
in many countries for many generations. As a
text for his pleasing sermon, Oseba said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To you, my children, to the Shadowas of
Cavitorus, it will seem strange, but among the
Christian Outeroos there is industrial confusion
about everywhere, with little prospect of early
harmony&mdash;for Zelania alone is a land without
strikes, without class hatred, and, of those
having parliaments, without a labor party in
the legislature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I conclude from the notes:&mdash;</p>

<p>Zelania was settled by an excellent class of
people, and though too much of the better lands,
as before remarked, were at first allowed to fall
into few hands, influenced by the isolation and
distance from the scenes that created the old
precedent, by the novelty of the environment,
from the necessities of discovering new expedients
to satisfy the new demands or conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and from the quickening influence of new
competition in a new, free, and exhilarating
climate, there was a rush of brains to the head
in Zelania, and a new shuffle of the cards was
called.</p>

<p>Where none were rich, and all had to hustle,
the &ldquo;grafter&rdquo; was respected. A community of
interests arose, and he who wrote and he who
wrought marched shoulder to shoulder, choosing
from among themselves the instruments or
servants through which the public conscience
should find expression in law.</p>

<p>In questions of colonial policy, none invoked
the &ldquo;shades of honored sires,&rdquo; none appealed
to the &ldquo;experience of the ages,&rdquo; none asked or
cared what Britain or America was doing, but
&ldquo;how can we construct the most comfortable
edifice from the material at hand?&rdquo; was the
problem they sought to solve.</p>

<p>If all those who have prayed, struggled,
fought, and died for liberty, from Otanes, the
Persian, down to the swarthy sons of Cuba or
the Philippines, could behold this scene, they
might well say&mdash;not in the words of Mr. Oseba&mdash;&ldquo;Lord,
now lettest Thou Thy servant depart
in peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Zelania there were no class contests.
There was no social revolution in the story, but
the people &ldquo;rose to the occasion,&rdquo; they looked
around inquiringly, yielded to the logic of the
situation, and&mdash;were.</p>

</div>

<p>Here the people saw clearly the fundamental
theory, or basic essentials of production. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>they saw Nature&rsquo;s treasure-house filled with
tempting rewards, and they soon realised that
toil was the open sesame to which Nature
responded promptly, and with a lavish hand.</p>

<p>They saw that &ldquo;labor and land,&rdquo; after a
long divorce, must re-wed&mdash;for the children&rsquo;s
sake&mdash;and that &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo; instead of being a
partial god that sprang from magic caves to aid
the cunning in squeezing humanity, was really
but the savings or net products of &ldquo;yesterday&rsquo;s&rdquo;
toil, and capital but that part of wealth devoted
to improving the implements with which toil
may more easily coin more wealth from the
stores of material, offered by Nature free to her
inquiring children. Who &ldquo;corners&rdquo; the raw
material, insults dame Nature, and assassinates
liberty.</p>

<p>There being some considerable unanimity of
feeling on these questions in Zelania, it was
deemed wise to arrange some equitable rules
for the working of the various factors, cogs,
wheels and pulleys of this complex machine.
Of course, a few persons who felt strongly that
they were entitled to complimentary passes to
all the public entertainments objected; but
these gentlemen were asked to stand by and
&ldquo;hold the &rsquo;phone&rdquo; while the inquiry was being
made.</p>

<p>Mr. Oseba said: &ldquo;So near is the Government
of Zelania to the doors of the people that
the laws are really but the recorded conclusions
of the community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people had learned&mdash;I conclude from
the notes&mdash;that in all countries and in all ages, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
monopolisation of the land with legal privileges
had resulted in insolent class distinctions,
poverty, misery, and oppression, and they
proposed to take up a collection, and erect
a new lighting-plant. For&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">Not for booty came the Briton, but for a home;<br />
And he built a State, from foundation to dome.<br />
In honor of his sire he &ldquo;grew.&rdquo; To the &ldquo;old chimes&rdquo;<br />
He listened, but he hewed and carved, to fit the &ldquo;times.&rdquo;<br />
As oracles, he inquired of &ldquo;Justice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Glory&rdquo;<br />
To him was naught, &ldquo;but works,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;live in story.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Oseba reminded his audience of the
rules regulating land tenure and &ldquo;settlement,&rdquo;
which held in view the broadening of the base
of the social pyramid, and he said the labor
laws were but extending the same principles to
other members of the productive or industrial
machines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The labor laws of Zelania,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are
unique; but they are only &lsquo;unique&rsquo; in ignoring
the &lsquo;experience of darker ages,&rsquo; in their purpose
to equitably distribute the burdens and profits
of industry, and in the desire of the framers to
secure permanent industrial peace and intelligent
social co-operation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The labor laws of Zelania may be said
to be but rules provided for the better understanding
between, and the better security
of the employer and employee, as joint promoters
of industrial enterprise, and nowhere
is the holder of wealth given an undue advantage
over the creator of wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The labor legislation of Zelania comprises
about thirty-five distinct Acts, and in tone they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
are usually almost more advisory than mandatory.
There are no general laws regulating
the hours of labor, or providing a minimum
wage, but in the interest of open-handed justice,
certain courts may exercise considerable power
when called upon to settle questions of this
character.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The labor legislation began in Zelania
as early as 1865, in &lsquo;The Master and Apprentice
Act,&rsquo; and has at least kept pace with
the rational demands of the community ever
since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The labor laws of Zelania, like her industries,
have grown gradually with the
country&rsquo;s requirements, as suggested by the
industrial unfoldment of the country. As
it is an industrial and commercial community,
the laws are designed to cover every
phase of business activity, to be specific in their
directions, simple in their application, and
speedy and inexpensive in their execution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uttering a truth, but possibly misquoting,
Mr. Oseba remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a despairing statesman once said,
&lsquo;Rome realises no danger, nay, she heeds
no warning, until the enemy is thundering
at her gates, when she must act without
deliberation,&rsquo; so, in like manner, the industrial
Acts of other countries are usually formulated
and passed to meet pressing emergencies, while
the sagacity of Zelania prepares, not for emergencies,
but that emergencies may not arise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While labor is the chief factor in the production
of all wealth, from a time to which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>&lsquo;memory&rsquo; of man runneth not to the contrary,
the select few, who cunningly possessed themselves
of the wealth, have treated with scant
courtesy those who created it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania, this &lsquo;time-honored custom&rsquo; has
been changed, for it has been ordained that he
who coins his sweat into the things that administer
to human wants, shall not be forgotten
by those who coin their cunning into magnets
for drawing the price of those things to their
commodious pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania, my children, people who toil,
who build houses, make corkscrews, and grow
asparagus, are regarded as considerably human,
even outside of Sunday-school and prayer meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here the power of one to toil and to produce
is considered his capital. His family, in
whom the community has an interest, is to be
considered and supported from this source, and,
if in the employ of another, such a person
meets with&mdash;or is overtaken by&mdash;an accident&mdash;his
capital impaired&mdash;he must be &lsquo;compensated.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
This, for a time, seemed a hardship
on employers&mdash;all changes being hardships&mdash;but
experience has proven otherwise, for the
practice not only produced a nobler &lsquo;fellow-feeling,&rsquo;
but mutual interest between the employer
and the employed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every change necessitates other changes,
and every new light exposes some defects that
call for improvement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In this measure there was a glimpse of
justice, but to obviate apparent hardships, the
State undertook to insure the laborer, and then
it was seen that private companies could find a
lot of&mdash;financially&mdash;healthy exercise in the same
line, and thus the industrial machine became
more symmetrical.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;To the casual observer, or to him who
regards the torch-bearer as an innovator luring
away his fetish, and to the wise-looking owl
that sits on the cemetery gate hooting at the
passing train of progress, these novel experiments
seem mischievous and revolutionary;
but in the early future, the long-eared politicians
of many lands will have to face the inquiry,
&lsquo;What has made Zelania the industrial paradise
of the world? Give us a smile from her
canteen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is changing the ideal, she is blessing
the brick and the mortar of which the Temple
of State is built.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&ldquo;If the State is made for woman and for man,<br />
You should make the man and woman&mdash;best you can.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The fact that for a dozen years, the
industrial machine of Zelania has worked
smoothly, and that, while in other lands there
has been much confusion, she has enjoyed an
era of unparalleled progress and prosperity,
should be some answer to the fears of those
who, because &lsquo;of old&rsquo; they made much gains
in furnishing Diana with her stage outfit, are
now feeling weary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;However, should these laws fail to satisfy
the aspirations of an educated people,&rdquo; Mr.
Oseba argued, &ldquo;the agents of the ultimate
authority would be instructed to adjust them
to the popular needs of society, and the new
patents would be issued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a fact, of all people the Zelanians alone
receive as much from, as they contribute to,
their Government.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure my children, not very
sure, that in all cases these liberal laws
have quickened the employee&rsquo;s stroke. I am
not sure that all employees are endowed with
sufficient grey matter to appreciate the fact that
every security or privilege conferred by law
imposes reciprocal obligations. To emancipate
a man, should ennoble him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A free man should scorn to soil his palm
with an unearned penny. The law that raised
the eyes of labor did not intend to direct them
to the face of the town clock, and the law that
forbade an employer demanding twenty shillings
worth of work for fourteen shillings in
truck goods, never meant that labor should take
from its employer a gold sovereign for fourteen
shillings&rsquo; worth of work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Justice and security should elevate the
soul, sharpen the sense of right, awaken the
energies and quicken the pace of all who fall
under these benign influences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure, not very sure, that all the
people of Zelania are worthy participators
in these noble benefactions; I am only explaining
the facts of the situation, the generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
sentiment that so largely prevails among the
people, and the purposes and intentions of the
makers of the law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course Zelanian statesmen may need to
remind the people, that increased effort will be
demanded for every opportunity given, and that
for personal success, energy, self reliance and
hustle must be wholly relied upon, or there may
be some misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whoever leans heavily upon the Government&mdash;not
the language of the chaste Oseba&mdash;usually
gets tired easy, so while it is well to
furnish every passenger with a life preserver,
the fellow who is too lazy to kick deserves to
die at sea, to save funeral expenses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my children,&rdquo; says Mr. Oseba, with
rather a human smile, &ldquo;as it is much less
wearisome to put on avoirdupois than to put on
grey matter, the social millennium has not yet
become firmly seated, even in Zelania.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, Mr. Oseba, they are steaming up and
they will get there all the same, for now that
the light has been turned on, the audience will
encourage the players to grander performances.</p>

<p>In all changes in life there are sorrows.
We come into, and go out of life with pain.
In every advance some are left behind, by
every improvement some hand is left idle,
until it is trained to a new duty. Every
economic advance violates some custom under
which hoary wrongs found an honored refuge.</p>

<p>But I conclude, from many pages, that
Zelania&rsquo;s labor laws are still imperfect, as
the leaders themselves recognise, by further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
improving them. But she is safe in her
situation, and these eternal principles of
justice are destined to exercise a wide influence
throughout the world, for improved
light always gives the whole plant a more
symmetrical growth.</p>

<p>To the undeviating progress of the industrial
situation of Zelania, the world is indebted, first,
of course, to her unparalleled natural conditions,
second to the intelligence of her people, then
to her progressive statesmen, and especially
to R. J. Seddon and the able men who have
constituted his political family. These, without
tradition, history or precedent, have raised the
industrial plane of the country to a condition
approaching the social ideal&mdash;as per mandate.</p>

<p>Like Bolivar and Lincoln and many other
of humanity&rsquo;s torch bearers, Mr. Seddon, by
the force of his own genius, arose from the
industrial walks of life. His was not a meteor
flight bursting resplendently upon a startled
world; but faithfully biding his time, he came
prepared, and evidently he came to stay&mdash;for
the time of his leave-taking has not yet been
announced.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_270.jpg" width="450" height="310" alt="Kiwi / Milford Sound" />
<p class="center"><i>Kiwi.</i> / <i>Milford Sound.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Seddon was born a true Briton. He
was toughened by colonial experience, his
hands were calloused with honest toil, his
muscles were hardened with heroic struggles,
his intellect was developed by a broad and
intelligent observation of interesting events;
and he belonged to, arose from, and came
forward to serve the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He knew but one rank, that of the free
citizen; but one guide, the people&rsquo;s voice; but
one master, that of duty&mdash;as he understood the
command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, an upper seat became vacant, and,
having a ripe experience in parliamentary affairs,
appreciative authority, with inviting tones, remarked,
&lsquo;Richard, come up higher,&rsquo; and he
joined a strong Cabinet. He did his duty as he
felt it, and was a part of Zelania&rsquo;s most progressive
laws. He ripened with the ever-changing
seasons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Events hastened; the public appetite was
whetted, and said, &lsquo;More!&rsquo; Mr. Ballance, a
beloved Premier, foolishly died, a still higher
seat was vacant, and again appreciative authority
said, &lsquo;Richard, come up higher.&rsquo; He
became Premier&mdash;the most responsible position
in any country ruled under the British parliamentary
system&mdash;in 1893, and for ten years, with
the strength of a Hercules, the courage of an
Ajax, and the industry of an Ixion, he has
courageously worked in extending, amending,
pruning and consolidating the industrial rules
of Zelania, until the world that first looked on
with amusement, and then with inquiring interest,
now beholds with admiration the successful
workings of an industrial theory that
gives hope to humanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a product of the times. The opportunities
came, and he harmonised the conditions
with the interests and the aspirations
of his countrymen, and, without the use of
an elevator, he has reached the dome of the
temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The labor laws, like the land laws, are
based upon the enlightened selfishness of the
people in their organised capacity, the idea
being, not that everyone may, but that everyone
must, earn his or her own living&mdash;must be
a producer and not a pauper, a tax-payer and
not a vagrant. This is democracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people are not kept, but they are
allowed opportunities to keep themselves; they
are not aided as a charity, but they are
enabled, as a right, to earn and to have, and
to contribute to the general well-being of the
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Zelania the soil is a basis of wealth;
capital and labor are the active factors, and
society, for the good of each and all, proposes
that these factors shall peacefully pursue the
joint enterprise of production, according to the
dictates of justice and humanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is selfish, of course. Capital must be
secure, and industry must necessarily move her
tireless wheels. Then society, as a whole,
having an interest in each of its members, and
a stake in the proceeds, must be the arbiter in
all industrial disputes, and the interested parties,
being loyal members of the social compact,
must yield obedience to the public will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, that is worth embalming!</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">They numbered the people. If high or low,<br />
Was not worth asking; enough to know<br />
That each had wants; and, that all might live,<br />
Those receiving must willingly give.<br />
Then strove they in love, and not in hate,<br />
To build for aye this matchless State;<br />
For they knew that a temple could not endure<br />
That enriched the baron, and crushed the poor.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Society,&rdquo; continued the sage, &ldquo;made up
of the industrial cells, requires the security of
every shilling, the service of every member, and
the peaceful co-operation of all the factors in
every industrial enterprise, and as it has not
yet been determined how much of our imagined
&lsquo;natural rights&rsquo; we may be called upon to yield
for the general good, the passionless decision of
the public will, for the time being at least, must
be the only guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the benign <i>ægis</i> of a rule, bearing
the lengthened legend, &lsquo;The Industrial Conciliation
and Arbitration Act,&rsquo; there serenely
reposes the most perfect industrial security
known in this discontented world. The Labour
Laws of Zelania may be &lsquo;experimental,&rsquo; but
they sprang from the soul of the public conscience,
they were moulded by a desire to
secure impartial justice, and for many years
they have given a degree of industrial peace,
stability, and prosperity, that has won the
favour of the general citizenship, and is now
exciting the surprise and winning the admiration
of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, to cap the climax, my children,&rdquo;
said Mr. Oseba, &ldquo;of all the measures ever
calculated to confirm the claims of the Master
as to the &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo; of man, it has been
ordained in Zelania that, under liberal provisions,
all persons above the full age of sixty-five
years, shall be entitled to a life pension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In harmony with other liberal legislation,
support for these measures was asked, Oseba
informs his people, not as a matter of charity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
but of justice, for it seems to have been held
that as members of an industrial community,
all worthy persons were supposed to have
entitled themselves to a living, and that those
who found themselves indigent at that age, had
either met with misfortune, or had failed to
receive a just equivalent for his or her contribution
to the public wealth. There, it seems
to be recognised that the world owes, to all
men, a living, and that these pensions are
advances made to those who have failed to
&ldquo;collect&rdquo; what was properly due to them.
Rather new.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>A public sentiment that, above the taint
of charity, coins its &ldquo;respect for worthy old
age&rdquo; into sovereigns, that may be &ldquo;demanded
as a right,&rdquo; by the deserving, stands as far
above the pious cant of other countries&mdash;as
philosophy stands above superstition.</p>

<p>Indolence, poverty, sorrow and want are
common to human society, and benevolence
and charity have been lauded as saving
virtues for many ages; but here, where new
ideas seem to generate spontaneously, there
has arisen a novel notion&mdash;that so closely is the
world akin, that the very fact of a person
having taken the pains to be born, to behave
pretty well, to float to Zelania at the proper
time and to exist for sixty-five years, justly
entitles him or her to £18 worth of annual
&ldquo;respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is novel indeed,&rdquo; says Mr. Oseba,
&ldquo;and this notion, in its conceptions of human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>relationship, social duty and moral responsibility,
is nobler than all the sermons&mdash;save
one&mdash;ever preached on this little globe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;R. J. Seddon is no saint; I am told, my
children, he gets angry, he storms, and he may
use cuss words, but no poet, priest or philanthropist
ever uttered nobler thoughts than he,
in his championship of this progressive measure.
Only the dreamer can realise the far-reaching
moral grandeur, not of the measure itself, but
of the lofty sentiment upon which it is based&mdash;and
the Premier claimed to speak &lsquo;for the
people.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Considering the general backwardness of
the Outeroos in breaking old traditions and
especially in the direction of a greater recognition
of human brotherhood, or the rights of the
individual as a unit of society, the Zelanians
have another rule, even more surprising, as
you will see, for it is not only the offspring of
a sentiment or idea, as novel in its nobility of
conception as that upon which grew the old
age pension, but it is so radical a departure
from old British customs, as to startle a student
with its audacious demands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the older lands the desire, as well as the
custom, is to erect commanding fortunes and
to perpetuate wealthy and powerful families&mdash;though
many of the kindred struggle through
miserable lives in poverty; but in Zelania,
should a person who contemplates permanent
&lsquo;retirement,&rsquo; endeavor by will or &lsquo;last testament,&rsquo;
to leave all his belongings to the
&lsquo;white headed boy,&rsquo; or otherwise fail to provide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
according to his means, for the &lsquo;proper maintenance
and support&rsquo; of any of his dependents,
the Courts &lsquo;may go back of the returns,&rsquo;
inquire into the matter, practically annul &lsquo;said
will,&rsquo; and make such provisions as &lsquo;shall seem
fit,&rsquo; according to the demands of open-handed
justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania recognises every person as an
integral part of the social group, with reciprocal
rights and duties. An individual may
pray with and prey upon the community and
acquire &lsquo;much riches,&rsquo; and, as the legal custodian
of this &lsquo;lucre,&rsquo; he has considerable
latitude; but, as a fact, he is only a trustee,
and when he leaves his money in this world&mdash;lest
it should melt&mdash;he is not allowed to deprive
any of his dependents who may remain for a
time as members of the community, of all
&lsquo;consolation&rsquo; for his departure.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Contrary to the general notions of outside
barbarians, the advanced legislation in Zelania
is not the result of an erratic temperament, but
of advanced thought, of a nobler conception of
human duty, and a higher ideal of social progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania as a social entity is not a commanding
empire. She points to no glorious
traditions, to no rivers of blood, to no ancient
splendors with ruined aqueducts, fallen columns
or ivy-grown temples; no chained captives and
moss-grown universities, where hoots the hooded
owl; but representing a new phase of intellectual
aspiration, her sturdy statesmen have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>planted the banner of social progress beyond
the dreams of other lands, and they have made
her the most interesting, the most hopeful, and,
socially, the most conspicuous spot on the broad
surface of Oliffa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eloquent in his recital, Mr. Oseba closed
this topic:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The time is hurriedly coming, my children,
when the statues of Zelanian statesmen who
have pushed to their full realisation the noble
principles, towards which humanity has been
vainly struggling for countless ages, will adorn
the most popular niches, galleries, and squares
of the world&rsquo;s most civilised centres.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>SOME PLEASANT OUTINGS.</h3>

<p>Here Mr. Oseba runs off on a pleasing
tangent, and he leads us to the conclusion that
a tour of Zelania is a jaunt of unrivalled
pleasure; so full of change, of variety and
surprising incidents, that curiosity lashes one
forward, and physical vigor so rapidly improves
as to banish all thought of weariness. On these
tours good health is actually &ldquo;catching,&rdquo; and
the appetite always arrives before meal time.</p>

<p>He describes in interesting detail the ease,
safety and comfort, as well as the jocund
hilarity, of these kaleidoscopic gyrations, and
how easily, with a word and a wire from Mr.
T. E. Donne, the candid and competent tourist
manager, one may find the path to the noblest
scenes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That time may not hang heavily on the
spring bathers, millions of fish&mdash;better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Peter ever hauled from the Sea of Galilee&mdash;are
waiting in many lakes for the tempting fly, and
if one tires of glacier climbing in the South,
the woods are full of red deer, and other
nimble game, waiting to give him a wilder
sport.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="319" height="450" alt="A stag's head" />
<p class="center"><i>A Stag&rsquo;s Head</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;As for climate, I conclude that one may
choose that as he chooses his drinks, for he may
have sunshine or shower, chilling glacier or
burning valley, frozen or boiling lakes, simply
by switching on or off a new path. The weather
is &lsquo;almost always&rsquo; good, and as one may dodge
a storm by going fishing, instead of going
mountain climbing, or a hot wave by stalking
deer instead of hunting geysers or Maori
maidens, bad weather is not worth talking
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he turns the globe and shows that
Zelania is in the Southern Hemisphere, and
he expects that as soon as his discoveries are
made known, many thousands of people&mdash;to
avoid the severe cold winters of Europe and
America&mdash;will spend a season of eternal spring
among those romantic scenes. Here Mr. Oseba
grows eloquent. I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As bare-handed Nature, by her almost
infinite allurements, spanked the rude savage of
Zelania into an eloquent politician, so she
improves upon every animal turned loose upon
her palpitating bosom. Bring a little starved
rabbit to Zelania&mdash;well, it does not become a
tiger the same afternoon, but it soon begins
business, and in a brief period it has the &lsquo;lord
of creation&rsquo; on the defensive&mdash;for it is eating
him out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The offspring of every animal, every bird,
every lake, brook or river fish, brought to
Zelania, in a very short time greatly improves
in size and beauty. Well, so it is with people.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ENCORE ZELANIA.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
Again thy face, Sapho, though thou hast won the crown,<br />
The moon hangs high, return, let&rsquo;s laugh till she goes down.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The notes of Leo Bergin record no sign of
weariness, either on the part of the audience or
the orator. The sittings had been prolonged,
but a cheerful and most intelligent interest
seemed to have been preserved throughout,
and the closing scenes in the review of Zelania
had almost aroused enthusiasm. The curtain
had been rolled down for a brief intermission,
and as it was known that the last act was now
to be staged, all the anxiety and freshness of
a new sitting were manifest in the audience.</p>

<p>The lantern appliances had been removed,
and it was evident that the conclusions of these
unique proceedings were very near. The notes
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oseba arose, and when he stepped to the
footlights, and indicated his readiness to proceed,
he was greeted with an applause well
becoming a Boston audience on the appearance
of a Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the poetess Vauline, apologising for
the interruption at so late a stage in the proceedings,
ventured to inquire by what course
of reasoning the sage Oseba had reached his
conclusions that the Anglo-Saxon was destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
to a universal supremacy, and why the Zelanians
should now be regarded as the torch-bearers
of the future ages?</p>

<p>With a smile of approval Mr. Oseba
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question is timely and important.
Following the laws of natural progress up to
a certain point, survival depends largely on the
thickness of the skin and the length of the
claws, but, above that point, it is a question
of grey matter, and the Anglo-Saxon has
brains in his head. Well, the Zelanians are
a picked squad on the skirmish line of the
Anglo-Saxon legions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here again I &ldquo;boil down,&rdquo; and note
my own conclusions from Mr. Oseba&rsquo;s argument:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon intellect is the product of
more than 1,400 years of unparalleled vicissitudes,
and by its inherent virtue it has resistless
force. Progress is a question of intellectual
development, of susceptibility, adaptability, and
adjustability of a people, and in the constitution
of this racial brain are found all these
traits in full measure. Besides, in the Anglo-Saxon
character there are found a solid sincerity
and love of justice, that inspire a respect
and confidence that are irresistible. It is a
matter of brain&mdash;of ideal.</p>

<p>The ideals of Assyria, Persia, and Babylonia
were Empire&mdash;military conquest, and we see passing
over the stage but kingly splendor, and, as
a background, the gods that lashed the people&mdash;if
there were any&mdash;into loyal obedience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>The ideal of Egypt was durability&mdash;to
eternise the works of kings&mdash;based upon a
religious idea, and she erected the Pyramids,
still the wonder of the world&rsquo;s wonders.</p>

<p>The ideal of Ph&oelig;nicia was commerce, and
the ship was the type of her realised dream.
Here the city was greater than the empire, and
the merchant was greater than the king.</p>

<p>The ideal of Greece was beauty&mdash;then personal
beauty&mdash;in form and character. Under
the reign of this ideal came her noblest achievements.
But the Greek brain was erratic; the
Greek heroes were soon deified. The artist came,
and when the marble statue became the ideal
and also the idol, the Greek philosopher became
a sophist, and Greece fell a prey to a more
practical race.</p>

<p>The ideal of Rome was power, force and the
glamour of Patrician splendor. That the lower
orders might fight more bravely for the further
aggrandisement of the holy city, they were fed
on barley buns and flattered with an imaginary
freedom, but the ideal of Rome was force.</p>

<p>The ideals of Venice and Genoa were
wealth, luxury and art, and their palaces and
cathedrals&mdash;still the wonder and admiration of
the world&mdash;became their realised dreams; but
only these, and the folly of the Doge, remain to us.</p>

<p>The ideal of Spain&mdash;in her greatness&mdash;was
royal splendor, propped by the spiritual authority,
with subject colonies to furnish places for
favorites and revenues for the State.</p>

<p>The ideals of Britain were trade, the factory,
the shop, the ship, and the &ldquo;old family&rdquo;&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
occupy the easy seats. But these British ideals
developed individual enterprise, and soon it was
discovered that in Britain there were people.
Save for a few brief periods in Attica, from the
fall of Israel to the rise of Britain the <i>people</i> cut
little figure in recorded history.</p>

<p>The ideal of America, say up to the passing
of Lincoln, was personal liberty, and under this
sentiment she produced some of the noblest
characters that ever stood erect and wore the
image of God. But the gates were turned in,
millions came from afar, the earlier sentiments
were perverted, great wealth became the master
motive, and dollars have become the national
ideal.</p>

<p>All these countries have succeeded, if Mr.
Oseba&rsquo;s arguments are valid, in some measure
in developing the &ldquo;master motive,&rdquo; or in realising
the national ideal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my children,&rdquo; said Oseba, &ldquo;the
force of Zelania as a social leader is also in her
ideals, and as the conspicuous happiness and
prosperity of a people are the best evidence of a
benign rule, the appreciation of her ideals has
proved their utilitarian virtues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, by some exploit in mental gymnastics,
the Zelanians have chosen the highest
possible ideal, Justice&mdash;the enthronement of the
individual&mdash;and with the inherited instincts of
the race and a most favorable environment, it
was to be expected that, with the ripening
of the yearnings of man, humanity should
find its highest type in these Romantic
Isles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In closing, allow me briefly to recall to
your minds a few of the more important features
of my argument on these most interesting
themes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reminded you, my children, that
liberty never gained a victory in an old, well-established,
and wealthy nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reminded you that with great
wealth and population people become conservative,
the rulers cling to inherited
power, the wealthy fear change, and the
mass, by custom becoming loyal, reform
is impossible&mdash;or at best, progress is slow
indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reminded you that commerce is
the basis of modern civilisation, but that only
people inhabiting the water-front have ever
become sufficiently commercial to materially
influence any considerable portion of mankind;
and I have reminded you that it was only
through the colonial enterprise of commercial
nations that the great progressive movements
have been carried on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Further, I have reminded you that only in
the colonies, in new and isolated communities,
far removed from central authority, where
novel conditions required novel methods, is
self-reliance nourished, liberty aroused, and
social progress made possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, I have also further reminded you,
that of all the tribes, races, or nations that
ever loafed about the earth&rsquo;s surface, those of
Ph&oelig;nicia, Greece, and Britain were alone
capable of breaking away from inherited customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and asserting freedom of action, or of so
adjusting themselves to the requirements of a
new environment as to develop a state of
society differing materially from that of the old
order of things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, too, I have shown you the social
outposts of all the nations, and how improbable
it is that they should advance any further by
their own inherent force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reminded you also, that the total
or aggregate of human rights is the same in all
states, regardless of form or population, that,
like elbow-room, individual rights decrease
as the numbers participating increase, and that
of all things a great population is least to
be desired, and an over-population the most to
be dreaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Zelania occupies a unique position.
She has no traditions, she has no overlord, no
organised trusts, no vested rights in hoary
wrongs; she has no withering precedents, no
millionaire monopolies howling for victims, and
having room for many millions she may bide
her time, and if she cares for more people
she may make her own selection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With her numberless wonders to attract
the tourist, her splendid opportunities for
profitable industry, and her more wonderful
social situation to attract the inquiring
thousands from many lands, she will soon
become, with sagacious management, the
Mecca of the world&rsquo;s leisured wealthy, and
from these will come the best of all &lsquo;invaders.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My children, with all these splendid facts,
I would not advise the empty-handed to rush
to Zelania, hoping to secure an easy livelihood;
but no person with an inquiring mind who
loves Nature, who feels an interest in the social
progress of his race, and who is possessed of
moderate means, should allow himself to quit
this fair and interesting life, without visiting
this most charming of all lands, this paragon of
social happiness, this paradise of Oliffa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many of you, my children, after having
read my report, and having meditated more
deeply upon the pleasures and profits of travel
and observation, will make this pleasing visit,
and should the hospitable people of Zelania meet
any quiet, dignified, well-regulated stranger,
who says little, but sees and hears everything,
who inquires without criticising, admires without
flattery, lends freely to all his friends, and
pays his own bills, they may &lsquo;guess&rsquo; that he is
a &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo; from &lsquo;Symmes&rsquo; Hole.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Measures, my children, the character of
which would shock the tender sensibilities of
those who assume to be the saviours of society,
have vindicated the wisdom of Zelania&rsquo;s statesmen&mdash;by
the demonstrated applicability of
these measures to the necessities of modern
progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all spots on the surface of Oliffa, this
Zelania is most charming, and of all people on
the surface of Oliffa, these Zelanians have
made the greatest social advance, and occupy
the most favored position for future usefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, with all these masterful advantages,
with an ideal country, capable of supporting
many millions of people, she holds&mdash;with a
small number of the choicest of the race&mdash;her
own destinies in her own hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, my children, there is hope for the
world. Genius has annihilated time and space,
commerce has brought humanity so in touch,
that the light of inspiration may come from
without, and seeing the beacon from afar, the
oppressed of many nations will arouse and
demand &lsquo;a little more light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great idea, Mr. Oseba, worthy of the
&ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s Lore,&rdquo; for though the watchman on
the tower may be slow in gaining a glimpse,
his keen eye will finally behold its glowing
effulgence.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">With faith he hath struggled for reason and right,<br />
Withdrew from the darkness in search of the light;<br />
With face to the morning, and gazing afar,<br />
O&rsquo;er Southern horizons he spies a new star,<br />
And cries, &ldquo;Hail, Zelania! though distant thou be,<br />
Welcome thy light shining over the sea;<br />
Welcome thy flag, to the heavens unfurled,<br />
The beacon, the guide, and the hope of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zelania is like unto another prophet, teaching
from the mountain top. The blaze of her
divine torch is not of a fitful glare, but the
genial rays of its steady glow are so spreading
over all the earth, that the people of all lands
may soon behold and wonder, and inquire, and
then emulate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my children, the tales of my strange
adventures are well-nigh told. The curtain will
soon fall, and while the lessons from these happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>sittings will remain with us as but fading memories,
the wonders of this enchanting land will
thrill and fill the inquiring souls of men for all
time&mdash;for the day of Zelania is just at the
dawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inspired by an inherited instinct, and
guided by Anglo-Saxon genius, civilisation has
won more victories since the crowning of Victoria
than during all the generations from &lsquo;Saul
of Tarsus&rsquo; to Paul of Pretoria, and Zelania is
away in the vanguard of the great progressive
social force that is destined to enlighten the
brain and unfetter the limbs of humanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is manifest destiny that Anglo-Saxon
aspiration, language, and civilisation should
dominate the world. With the realisation of
this hope, business interests will prevent war;
despotism will be good-naturedly hissed from
the stage; Europe will be commercially united;
production and exchange will be so adjusted
as to employ all willing hands; the arsenals
will become factories; the great guns will be
stood erect as pillars in historic museums; the
muskets will be cast into gas pipes, and swords
into sheep-shears, and the gods will look down
and smile upon the first generation of truly
civilised men!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, at the consummation of these noble
purposes, when a monument shall have been
erected in honor of those who led in the emancipation
of humanity, on the highest tablet on the
Temple of Eternal Fame, and in letters of
imperishable splendor, shall be emblazoned,&mdash;</p>
